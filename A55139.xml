            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>But the poor Women must not be thus run down for want of a little Logick. Rather let 'em bear up to the Bar of <hi>Chester;</hi> let 'em pluck up a good Heart, and retort upon their Male Adversaries, the Calumnies which they would fix upon their Innocence.</p>
            <p>One Man Condemns Matrimony, because he has a Shrew to his Wife; which is only for want of Knowledge: For a Shrew is the best Woman in Nature; and makes a Man both a Poet and a Philosopher. A Combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an <hi>Amazon</hi> with her Skimmer and Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, and the Knight of the Basting-Ladle, is a Theam for a Second <hi>Homer.</hi> And then she makes a Man a Philosopher by exercising the noblest of his Virtues, his Patience. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother blames Wedlock for having a Slut; whereas Sluttery is but an Emblem of the simplicity of the Old World, before Pomp and Luxury came in Fashion. A Third banns Marriage, because he thinks himself a Cuckold; and yet there's not one in Five thousand that cares to be confin'd himself. Another says his Wife loves Brandy, and therefore Storms at Matrimony; as if <hi>Bacchus</hi> were not as well Female as Male; and Women had not a<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

But should we bring the Miscarriages of Men, and the Womens Failings, both to the Bar of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and weigh them both one against the other, 'tis to be feared the Men's Scale would be so Heavy as that you could hardly lift it, and the Women's so light as scarcely to be felt.

               <p>THERE is nothing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, nothing more coveted by both the Sexes of Men and Women, than Matrimony. It has been in high esteem among all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from the beginning of the World. And this desire it was that made <hi>Cain</hi> take such a tedious Journey into the Land of <hi>Nod,</hi> to get him a Wife: For there is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural propensity in Man, to propagate and continue his kind. Now least this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensity should slacken in either Sex, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has furnished <hi>Matrimony</hi> with those Concomitant and Convenient Pleasures and Delights, which render it so Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it is impossible to prevent the Impetuosity of Ardent Flame, and Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful desire. <hi>Venus</hi> whom the Poets feign to be the Goddess of Pleasure, Caresses, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and Carnal Procreation, was Born out of the Genitals of <hi>Coelum,</hi> snipt off by <hi>Saturn</hi> in a Jealous Frolick, and thrown into the Sea; where she had her Birth without a Mother, from the Froth of those
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43678:5"/> Parts; which was done in Honour of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, to deifie Coition and Natural Conjunction. Till that time, they say, that the whole Race of Fish was almost extinguished; but so soon as <hi>Venus</hi> had power over the Sea, then it was that Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and Mackrel began to encrease at that prodigious rate as now they do. She was Cradl'd first in a Mother of Pearl-shell, to show that the Nuptial S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eets ought to be without defilement; she was also said to be Born Laughing, for that Sweetness, Chearful Discourses, Smiles, and Caresses ought to be the Concomitants of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Some say indeed that when she came to be Marry'd, she would now and then take up a Stone with her Ear; which is the Reason that Matrimony does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways succeed so happily as might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd: Without doubt her Familiarity with <hi>Adonis,</hi> was a spot to her Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and her being taken in the Act with <hi>Mars,</hi> was another stain to her Honour: But that she was the first Inventress of Whoring can never be, because it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that there were many Women in the World before she was Born. Besides, she was a Goddess of a haughty, revengeful Humour and one that mortally hated a slight: Insomuch that when the <hi>Lemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43678:5"/> Women neglected the Sacrifices, which she lookt upon to be her due, she did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to 'em, that occasion'd such a rank smell and strong perfume from their Bodies, that their Husbands could not endure 'em. Thereupon the Men made a War with their Neighbours, and plunder'd all the Women out of their Enemies Country, to supply the Room of their all-to-be-<hi>Assa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foetida'd</hi> Wives: which put the Women into such a rage, that in one Night, they killed all their Husbands, and their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Mistresses; and least their Sons should revenge the Death of their Fathers when they came of Age, they slew them too. This was a bad Example, which many Women are too apt to follow, and daily put in practice, if their Husbands fail their Expectations, and neglect to give them their due.</p>
               <p>Now for these Reasons, and forsome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, too long to enumerate, tho Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny has been all along thus deify'd, tho' there be nothing more desired, and sought after by all Ages and Sexes, and tho' it have several Comforts and Complacencies in it; yet there is a General Clamour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and there are others that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it, inveigh against it, and cry it down, as the only occasion and Root of

               <p>If there are <hi>Fifteen</hi> Comforts in Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; by'r Lady, there are enough, (for who would not Marry to enjoy Fifteen Comforts?) I wish we may make our words good, and find out Fifteen; for the Ancient Philosophers counted Seven to be the Number of perfection; now in Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen there is twice Seven, two perfect Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and one to spare. So that had Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony but Seven Comforts, it had the <hi>perfect Number</hi> of Comforts, which were sufficient; but Fifteen is a Number of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43678:7"/> we should find a great many more. But first let us see to make out these Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, and then a Figg for <hi>Pandora</hi> and her Box to boot.</p>

               <p>ALL Men that design Matrimony, must first pitch upon some object of his Affections, which must be a living Person of the Female Sex. To which purpose when he considers his Youth, his Strength, his Vigour, Health and Riches it cannot be a small Comfort to him to find himself so qualify'd for such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant enterprize. But if he be handsome withal, he has this additional satisfaction and confidence in himself, that there are m re <hi>Maids</hi> than <hi>Maukin,</hi> and that the World, being so wide as it is, if one will not, another must stoop to his easie Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>Now then, what's the first thing to be done?— Why, in the first place the young Courtier trims himself in <hi>Querpo,</hi> and according to his degree makes himself as fine as Thimbleman and Sempstress can make him; pays for his Cloths, or goes upon Tick with his Taylor; and then 'tis no small Comfort to him that he can be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43678:7"/> trusted. After that he marches in his Pontificalibus to some eminent Church; there he stares, gapes and looks about him; and instead of lending his Ears to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, with all the content imaginable feeds his Eyes, gratifies and satiates his Fancy with variety of Objects, and picks out three or four which he thinks may prove for his turn.</p>
               <p>This done, he finds out their several Habitations, makes diligent Enquiry after their Fortunes, at whose disposal they are, whether of Guardians, or Fathers, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or both; whether closely kept in, or left to Freedom; and which way the most proper to make his Addresses. An Employment or rather spending of a young Mans time, than which there can be none more agreeable to exercise the mind and thoughts of an Amorous Sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, who all this while believes himself wrapt up in his Mothers Smock, and thinks no Virgin able to withstand his brisk Assaults.</p>
               <p>After this he takes his Friend to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, unbosoms his Amours, drinks her Health, and Gad (quoth he) a pretty Black-ey'd, Smirking Rogue—I would I had her in her Night-Clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43678:8"/> — Were I i'thy Condition, I'd make no more to carry her, than to drink of this Glass — and so here'a to her again. Thus is the Young Lover in a pleasing Ecstasie, and ravished with his hopes, drinks on till he believes he has her in his Arms. What Hours of greater Bliss than these? While a Man's Senses shall be all the while, as it were wrapt up in such Pleasing Dreams as will not let the least disquiet enter to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy his Thoughts?</p>
               <p>The very beating his Brains to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish his design, are all along a pleasure to him. For Lovers like Warriours in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of Victory, take delight in the toil and management of their Contrivances.</p>
               <p>And perhaps by this time he has found the Maid to be his Mistresses Crony and Cabinet Counsellor. Now there is no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother, Unkle or Aunt, that will deny a Young Spark the first Visit when he comes, as they say, in the way of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty. In what a Rapture of Joy is he then upon his first Admittance? One Kiss of Formality, a Gracious Smile to his first Complement recompense an Age of future Powting and Lowting, should it so fall out. The happiness of one Hours first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of her Virgin-Company, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>values the succeeding Curtain Lectures of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43678:8"/> her whole Life. The Comforts of Woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> great, that I am apt to think, if a Man were to Wooe once a Month, <hi>Solon</hi> would have alter'd his Judgment, and counted him the happiest Man i' the World. Then at his Departure he steals into the Maids Hand the King's Picture imprinted upon a small round piece of Gold, which begets such a Character of him in the Maids Breast, that she extols him from Top to Toe, praises the very Buckling of his Shooes, as having something in it beyond the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of other Men, and reads him all over to her Mistress as the only person fit to be Entertained in her Affections, but above all things forgets not to make particular Observations upon the proportion of his Nose. Within a day or two my Spark goes again, at which time the Officious Maid is ready to Conduct him up Stairs; and by her Smiles and her Curches, gives him to understand that his Yellow Physick has wrought. If the Lady becoy and keep a formal distance; 'tis no more then what he was rationally to expect; for it is not yet seasonable to come bluntly to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: However he finds her Complaisant, and Modestly Civil; which enlivens him with fresh hopes, and inspires new joys into his Soul. Here happens a longer stay
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43678:9"/> and more hours of Comfort, and Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation worth a Bushel of <hi>March</hi> Dust; so that the young <hi>Inamorato</hi> takes his leave with all the satisfaction in the World: yet not so forgetful neither of his Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Sollicitress, but that he drops ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cordial into her wary hand, Cuds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodikins, (quo she) to her Mistress, within a day or two after, where do you think I ha' bin this morning? I don't know, (quo the young Gentlewoman;) Why Fachins I have bin with the Conjurer at <hi>Black-Friars Gate</hi>— He's the rarest Man in the World—I ask'd him whether such a Gentleman did Court my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, or no?—And he did but only cast his Eye in a great Book, and told me, Yes. Nay he describ'd the Gentleman by his Cloths and his Hair, so exactly as if he had drawn his Picture; and told me he was the Person and no other that was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd for you—for your better satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, I would have you go to him your self—'tis but missing your Prayer time to morrow Morning and taking a tripp to his Chamber. This fires the young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, and away she trips from her Devotion to Consult <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Gemini,</hi> concerning her Sweet-heart: And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conjurer told her so right, when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43678:9"/> the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now what greater Pleasure can a young Wooer have, than to understand, (for the Maid, if she be not a worse Devil than the Devil she went to, will be certain to give him Intelligence of these important passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) I say what greater pleasure can a young Wooer have, than to understand that his Mistress is so afraid of missing him, that she goes to the Devil's Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to consult the assurance of her Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</p>
               <p>Embolden'd therefore by these successes, the young Wooer begins now to think of setling a Correspondence; which his new purchas'd Friend, the Chamber-maid, is not only dextrous, but officiously ready to manage. Then he writes, and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress Answers; then he Answers, and his Mistress writes again; and this begets more rejoinders and surrejoinders than a Chancery Sute. What tho' the Language be borrow'd on both sides? What tho' the softness and meltingness of the Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions were not inspir'd by Nature, but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Academy of Complements,

                  </gap>g of an Amorous Complacency towards him, 'tis enough. Then what a Surmounting pleasure it's to him, to read it over and over again? He kisses and busses it; sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and smiles to himself; lifts up his Eyes and Hands to Heaven; blesses and huggs himself with his own Arms, that were to be seen in these Transports of his Amorous Passion; there's no Body but would think him an Antick, or a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. All the day long he believes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in Paradise; and at Night laying the Letter, or rather <hi>Billet doux</hi> upon his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, falls into more pleasing Dreams then ever lull'd <hi>Endymion</hi> upon the Mountain <hi>Ida.</hi> What greater pleasures can a young Wooer wish for, unless it were the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43678:10"/> it self? But because that cannot be presently had, therefore the little Winged Archer diverts his Fancy in these pleasing Elysiums, encircl'd with a thousand flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beatitudes.</p>
               <p>But this is not all, presently fresh Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence comes, that his Mistress is to be such a Night at a great Dancing bout at <hi>Pin-makers-Hall, Wine-Office-Court</hi> in <hi>Fleet-street,</hi> or let it be where it will.

If a young Lawyer, he b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

By and by to the Dancing-School he comes, as fine as a Lord, enters the Room, looks for his Mistress, she is not there; by and by she comes—but then how he smirks and simpers! What would he have more, unless he were a Bed with her? He is present with his Mistress, he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43678:11"/> has her by the Hand, the delight of his Soul, the joy of his Heart, he feels her Palm, he whirls her about in a Country Jigg; and by and by calls for a kissing Dance—Can any man be so sottish as to think this is no pleasure to a young Wooer? Cuds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, he must needs have lost his Senses that thinks so. By and by he pretends to whisper under her Hood, and steals a kiss—Nouns and Pronouns, do ye think that's no pleasure to a young Wooer? She Sweats, and he Wipes off the Pearls from her Nose, with Handkerchief dipt in Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Oranges—She sits down to rest her self, and he sits down by her, tells her a thousand pretty Stories, and squeezes her Hand all the while—Then comes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther young Lady, and takes the young Wooer out, as they call it; and then he has an opportunity to shew the roundness of his Calves, the neatness of his Feet, his handsome Shape, and nimble Limbs; for he Dances like any thing—because his Mistress is in presence. Then he comes and sits down by his Mistress again, wipes his Face; and with his smiling Eyes seems to ask her, how she lik'd him? To which she with a smiling Eye and a blushing Cheek, seems to make answer and cry, mightily Well. Then a Gentleman takes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43678:11"/> his Mistress out—and then is he blest with the most charming sight in the World—he admires her swimming car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage—the holding of her Petticoat bewitches him, and the Coelestial motion of her Buttocks transports him; but the brideling her Chin, and the ruddy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in her Cheeks, ravishes him up into the third Heaven. Then she comes and sits down by her sweet Swatterkin again, who seems to be transported with Joy; and tells her in her Ear, with a 'Protest and a vow, <hi>Madam,</hi> that she danced like an Angel: Then she wipes her Face, but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Handkerchief up in a careless man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he takes an occasion to steal it from her, and conveys it into his own Coat-Pocket. Verily, if I don't believe, 'twas some Handkerchief-Stealer that invented those Pockets, hang me, they are so very convenient. But then he thinks himself as rich as if he were Landlord of all the Mines of <hi>Peru:</hi> I'll warrant you, he would not part with that Handkerchief for all the Silver that was so lately recover'd out of the Sea. For this Handkerchief works Miracles too; it makes the young Wooer a Poet to a Miracle, tho' he never made Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses before; yet he sends her such a Copy
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43678:12"/> upon the Stealing of her Handkerchief, that she never repents the losing it.</p>
               <p>But now they take leave of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny before the Meeting break up: Why so? because time wastes, and there's more to be done. For as they go down Stairs, the young Wooer humbly beseeches his young Mistress to let him wait upon her to the Tavern: The young Maid seconds him with her perswasions; nor is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress so obstinately Refractary, but that she suffers her self in the conclusion, to be over-rul'd by her Confident: So the young Wooer puts her into a Coach, and away they drive to the place appointed. And now he has her as safe as a Thief in a Mill—now he may Vow, Protest, Swear, Lye, and say what he pleases — Now if he be a well b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

'Tis well there's no more Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that their Bellies are not so big as so many Tuns of <hi>Heidelbergh;</hi> for her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence will admit of no pinching, there must nothing appear of the Miser in her sight, but all the Signs of Liberal, Noble, Gentile, Careless, Great, and what the Women call a handsome Spirit. For young Virgins, tho' never so niggardly themselves, love to observe Liberality and Profuseness in the choice, in hopes to have the benefit of pocketing up the over-plus of their Husbands Expences another day. For the Devil's in some of your young Women, they look before 'em a great way, and are for laying up against a Rainy day, as soon as they have a Man in their Eye.</p>
               <p>But to return to our young Wooers Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, now you find him all in joy and pleasure, tasting the Cherries of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses Lips, cropping the Lilies of her Hands, and receiving the <hi>Arabian</hi> perfumes of her Breath, to that degree, that you may well believe him to be in Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth. A' my word, beloved, this is a pleasure in Wooing, not to be slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—'tis somewhat costly you'll say— What's that to the purpose? There was a Philosopher that gave above Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43678:13"/> pound for one Nights Lodging with a Curtezan; if a Fool then spend a Piece or two, upon his Darling Mistress, his Honest, Chast, Vertuous Darling Mistress, is that such a piece of business? Why there are some men that would give their backsides for such a happiness as this young Wooer may be thought to enjoy at such a Time.</p>
               <p>Well, but now 'tis time to go home least the Mother should be angry, for upon my word 'tis past ten a Clock: But the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil helps that Devil of a Chamber-maid, for she had so order'd it before-hand, that they are both let in without knocking at the door, by the Cook-Wench, who is fee'd to stand Sentinel and watch their coming home. Thus the door silently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, in they slip, up they whip into their Chamber, undress in a trice, and come down in their Night-geer, as if they had been at home an hour or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore—Lord, where ha' you been, (quo the Mother) —Lord, Mother,— Lord, Mistress, both together cry they, we have bin at home above this Hour—I did not hear ye come in, (quo the Mother) —No forsooth, (quo the Maid)— we came in just as <hi>Dick</hi> was shutting up shop, and knocking in the Door-post.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:43678:13"/>
               <p>Thus is all well at home, and the young Wooer returns to his Lodging the most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd lover in the World; nor does his Pleasure at all diminish, because the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is past. His Mind and Conceit are so full of his last Delights, that he seems to act over the same thing every hour agen. He Kisses her in Conceit, he Dances with her in Conceit, he Drinks to her in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, he Talks to her in Conceit: Nay, his very Dreams are still new Trances of Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. And when he hears the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what a Trick the Maid put upon her Mistress, his Heart molds Kockle-Bread in his Belly for joy.</p>
               <p>Another has an Opportunity to carry his Mistress to <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-Fair, or <hi>Southwark</hi>-Fair. Why, Pleasures of the same kind at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend both Parties, still Pig Treatments, and Pork-Treatments: He carries her to see this Show, and that Show, and the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Ropes. He forgets not to carry her to the Royal-Oak Lottery, and to throw away forty or fifty Shillings to learn her the manner of the Game. Nay, and he must let her see him Raffle too. 'Tis a hard case if Fortune should be so unkind to him, as not to let him present his Mistress with a good piece of Plate, or a Looking-Glass in a Tortoise-Shell Frame. They'll be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43678:14"/> his own again, when once they are Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
               <p>In Summer, if the weather be fair, he attends her in the Forenoon to Church, in the Afternoon to <hi>Islington,</hi> where he spares for no cost in Bottle Ale, Stew'd Prunes, Cakes, Tarts, and Gammons of Bacon. So that still, there's nothing but Pleasure and Plenty in Wooing. Nay, and if she require it, he must not scruple to borrow her a Pad-Nag, and a Side-Saddle, and Gallop her to the Camp. For she that is (perhaps) to bring many Souldiers into the World, ought not to be ignorant what 'tis to be a Souldier. Perhaps she does it to try his Obedience and Affection, and then, Cuds-foot, a Denial would spoil all. For we must not deny, but that a young Woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may be a Wretched, Miserable, Deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Forlorn Creature. But then it must be either his own or Natures fault. As when his Mistress looks upon him to be a Fool, or a Halfwitted Fellow, a Niggardly, Close fisted, Narrow-Soul'd Rascal; or if she finds that he wants Money; and then she pisses upon him for certain. Unless she have Money enough of her own, and the young Raw-bones be handsome and <hi>Roman</hi> Nos'd; for then tho' he should happen to be her Father's Groom, or his Butler, she
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43678:14"/> may chance to take an Affection to him; and then he's happy again.</p>
               <p>If the fault be Nature's, then perhaps he proves to be Blear-ey'd, Hunch-back'd, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker-legg'd, Tutt-mouth'd, or the like: And then he is not so pleasing, unless his Purse gingle; then she loves his Estate, not his Person; then she Marries his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, not the Man himself, proceeds wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and trusts her Parents to make the Bargain for her, and bids 'em be sure to get her a good Jointure, and to take care it be sure settled. However, 'tis a great Pleasure to such a piece of Deformity, that he has an Estate to buy him a handsome proper Wife. 'Tis true, there are some Virgins that admire Men for their Wisdom, tho' they meet with it in a Case as ugly as <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop</hi>'s; but they are but very few. You may lock 'em up all in a Closet no bigger than <hi>Little-Ease.</hi> We have romag'd History, and can light but upon one; and this one single Phoenix fell so in Love with a great Philosopher, that she told her Parents she would kill her self, unless she might have him. The Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were very loth to lose their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and yet they were as loth to bestow her upon the Philosopher, because they knew him to be a needy, beggarly, poor
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43678:15"/> Scholar, tho' a man of deep Wisdom and very great Learning. Well, the Maid wou'd have no denyal, she would have him or no body in the World. On the other side, the Philosopher, to divert her Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, threw off his Mantle, and turning to the Maid; troth Mistress (quo he,) if you will have me for your Husband, you must take me with this Mountain upon my Back, and these crooked Legs; and which is worse, my left Hip and my left Arm-pit meet almost together. Then he shew'd her his Staff and his Satchel wherein he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd his Victuals, and bid her consider how she lik'd his Estate; besides he let her know, that he should never love a Wife that would not live as Philosophically as he did. But nothing would do, she would be a Philosopher, or any thing rather than go without him. Ay, quo' the Philosopher, nay then Sweet-heart have at thee by guess; and so spreading his Cloak Philosophical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Ground; he put his Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy in practice, in the presence of his Wives Father and Mother, and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of her Kindred. And when they asked him what he was doing? He made answer, <hi>he was planting a Man.</hi> This Philosopher, if the Story be true; and I have a very good Author for what I say;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43678:15"/> you may be sure (say you) had eaten shame, and drunk after it. But that's your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake; for he had shew'd her all his defects he had, and now he was resolved to shew what sort of Nuptial Bed she was to expect if she Married him; so that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but plain dealing on the Philosopher's side. And for the Virgin, she shew'd her self to be a true self-denying Creature, and that for Vertues sake, she could have been contented, to have been lain withal, in the way of Honesty, upon the bare Ground; had her Philosopher so pleased. Truly I could not omit this Story, thereby to teach young Gentlemen this Philosophical way of Kissing; and to let 'em understand how much better it would be, when they carry their Misses to the Tavern; to spread their Chamlet Cloaks, or their Bays Coats up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Floor Philosophically, than to break so many Leathern, and Turky-work Chairs as they do, to the great injury of the Man of the House.</p>
               <p>On the other side, if the Man be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and well built, and the Woman have a Wart upon her Back as big as the top of a Chimney, Legs like your Serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Pillars, a Splay Mouth, Red Hair, and an Acron-colour'd Skin, then you may be sure there's Money i' the Case; and it may
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43678:16"/> be, 'tis all her Parents have: So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then, is a young Wooer of such a piece of Natures Miscarriage without several Comforts and Consolations. The Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine of her Gold so dazles his Eyes, that he sees none of all her Deformities; the weight of her Bags levels the Hillock at her Back; the lustre of her Portion streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens her Legs; and then all Men that love Gold must needs have a kindness for Goldy-Locks. By my Troth, when a Man has but a little to trust to, or that his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune runs low, 'tis time for him to look about him; and therefore, when a Man in such a condition, hears of one of these Prizes, there's as much Pleasure in Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a Lame, Decrepid Help at Need, as if she were one of the <hi>Graces.</hi> Besides, there are some Men not so Squeamish as others: There are some will no more keck at a Rich Girl, with her Eyes as Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shod as if her Eye-Brows had been Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciz'd, than they would at the sight of a flaw'd piece of Elder. There was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman had Marry'd a rich Heiress, and when he was to have gone to Bed to her, he was so Squeamish forsooth, that his Brother, a bold <hi>Britain,</hi> was forc'd to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate the Marriage: And this for no other Cause, but because she had Legs no
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43678:16"/> bigger than Goose Quills, and was as crooked as a Semicircle: For to tell ye the truth she was stolen, and they fear'd a surprize, before they could get the business compleated.</p>
               <p>But if she be a Rich Heiress, and not to be obtained without stealing, then all the pleasures of Wooing meet together. 'Tis no matter whether she be to be stolen from a Boarding-School, or from the Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Parents; 'tis the same thing: there must be a Confident within doors, and a Mistress <hi>Go-between</hi> without. Oh! the Matron, with a Band-box of Hoods and Scarfes under her Arm, is a Parlous Creature. Then come the Comforts and Pleasures of Plots and Contrivances: For there is pleasure in danger, especially when a man comes off with Honour. The young Wooer comes to the Boarding-School, to see the young Ladies Dance, and there takes his first view. There Love like Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der takes Fire immediately; but he comes thither in publick no more. A <hi>Billet doux</hi> first intimates his Affection, and the young Lady that saw him a brisk, trimm, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, streight young Gallant, begins to think him not unworthy her kindness; besides that she is in the prime of her Age, bux<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m and high mettl'd. Nor can she
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43678:17"/> long conceal the Commencements of her Amorous inclinations from her confident; she adds Fuel to the Flame, heightens her Fancy, and inflames her desires; swears the Gentleman worth no less than Eight hundred a year, and that she knows his Family, and where his Estate lies. On the other side, the young Wooer fills his Gilt Paper Pages with Vows, Oaths, and Protestations; tells her she shall ride in her Coach, and gives her fare hopes of being a Lady. Now in all these things, there is a strange pleasure and Titillation of the Fancy. At length the business is so brought about, that she gives him a private meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then there's Kissing and Billing, redoubled Protestations, and Vows; he kneels at her Feet, and adores her as his Guardian Angel: In a word, he tells her such pleasing Stories, such deluding flim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flams (and who can deny the vast plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that attends upon delusion,) that the young Lady is at length fully convinc'd, and the business is concluded, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable joy of the young Wooer. And now the Cabal have work enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive which way to release the Female Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner. At length after many debates and serious Consultations, the night being pitch'd upon, down she is let in a Dust
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43678:17"/> Basket, from her Chamber Window, like a bundle of Feathers from an Upholsterers Garret, and lights into the Arms of her dearly beloved, who, you may be sure, is carefully and diligently ready, with his Friends and his Horses, to mount and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Good night Madam; we shall see you no more, I'm sure, till you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what's what. Now, what greater pleasure can there be to a young Lover than thus to succeed in an Enterprize of so much difficulty?</p>
               <p>But now, suppose the Wooer be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of more sober years, drawing dry-foot after a rich Widow, why neither are these sort of Wooers, whether stale Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellors, or Widowers, without their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in <hi>Wooing.</hi> For as it is a pleasure to stand upon the Foil, and see the turnings and doubling of a Hare before the Hounds; with no less delight, does a cunning Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow-Wooer observe the Tricks and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties of a cunning Widow; and with no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ss pleasure does he Study and Contrive, which way to countermine her. Which if it be so great in making his Approaches only; what must his satisfaction be, when he gains the Fort? Men take vast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Hunting and Fishing, that little care for the Game when 'tis caught. Such
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43678:18"/> is the Sport of Widow-courting, where the heat of Youth being over, the pleasure lies in Conquest, more than in future En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment. Men have been Trick'd 'tis true, when they have seen suborn'd Tenants, in Country Habits, bring in full Baggs at one door, but not seen 'em carry it out at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and there was but little Comfort in that, when the Plot took effect. But if a man discovers the plot, then he is no less pleased with the subtilty of his Wit, and the good Issue of his Sagacity. Besides there is a particular pleasure in Courting a Widow, because he knows what he must trust to, as having had a true Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand of her carriage to her first Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. There is also another pleasure in Courting a Widow, that a man talks and discourses with a Person that understands Trap. And thus, it is a pleasure for a man to talk with an Artist, in a Science which he understands himself; whereas it is the most tiresome thing in the World, for a man of Learning, to converse with an Ignorant Simpleton. Think you it is not a very great pleasure to a sober man, to find that he is like to have a <hi>Saint</hi> for his Wise? And certainly such must that same Widow be, that is such a daily han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Morning Prayers, and observes her
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43678:18"/> hours as punctually as a <hi>Quotidian Ague,</hi> and saves the Sexton, I know not what in Brooms, by sweeping the Church with the long Tail of her Gown. Another pleasure it is, that a Man will have a knowing experienced Woman; one that will be able to instruct him, if he be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant himself: nor will it be his ill Fortune to go to Bed the first Night, with his Brains full of Anxious and disquieting Thoughts, for fear he should not find his Wife what he took her to be, a <hi>Maid.</hi> In a word, Wooing is the most pleasing Pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in the World; it affords pleasure and satisfaction to Men of all sizes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: It procures a Cessation of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cares, and a Truce from business all the while, tho' strange to tell, a Man is then about the most serious business of his whole Life. Tho' it last a year, 'tis all the time Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-day. The Divine cannot Study all that Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, all that while 'tis impossible for him to Preach, or if he do, he talks beside the Custom. And yet he has an Advantage, now I think on't, above all other Arts and Sciences; for he may Court his Mistress out of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> if he pleases; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided she be but aware of it before hand.</p>

               <p>The Physician Doats, and forgets his Patients. The Lawyer takes hold of the Opportunity, and dispatches his Business in a long Vacation. The Souldier lay close Siege in the Winter. But let it be Vacation, or Term time, Winter, or Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, if the Business hang, and Love be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate, the Lawyer's never to be found, and the Souldiers Deaf to the Call of the Drum. You may as soon haul him to the Gallows as to the General <hi>Rendezvouz. Multa cadunt inter poculum,</hi> they cry, there's nothing certain till the Knot's ty'd.</p>
               <p>The Merchant leaves word at the Change, he's gone a Wooing; at least he had as good have done so; for Wooing-time is such a Christian-like Season, that it abstracts a Mans Thoughts from doating upon all other Affairs of this World. The Infatuated Countryman is in a Wood, and leaves his Plough, Harrow, Sickle, all for Love of <hi>Amaryllis.</hi> The Intoxicated Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cannot stay in his Shop for attending upon his Mistress.

               <p>Who shall now express the unexpressible joy of this same Constant Wooer, when he hears the blessed Word of Consent drop from the Coral Lips of his Alluring Mistress? Whatever he is doing, whatever trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting, still his Heart and his Thoughts are at his Mistresses Lodging. All the while he is from thence, he is like a Diver for Pearl, that lives a while out of his Element, but is forc'd to be drawn up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to recover Breath; in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Victorious Wooer is forc'd, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Business be abroad, to make
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43678:20"/> quick returns back again, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing utterly Confounded through the loss of his Heart and his Brains. Besides there are several forerunning Pleasures that will not now suffer him to be absent a Minute from her by his good will. For now he has free access; he may Kiss and play a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove board as much as he pleases; only there's a little shame and fear which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be forgotten, because they have not been as yet at the Church. However I would not have him yet awhile be so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of his Heart and his Brains; for there are several things to be done, wherein he will find the assistance of his Heart and his Brains to be very useful, and in which they will have great share of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>Precedent to which, it must needs be a very great Pleasure to the young Lover, to see himself now the only welcome Guest to the House, where but a little before, every Body look'd askew upon him. The Graver sort receive him kindly, the Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sort familiarly, so that he is become one of the Family already. And it cannot choose but be a wonderful pleasure to him, to hear every Body commend his choice, and telling him withal, what a Vertuous, Careful, Diligent, Kind disposition'd Wife
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43678:21"/> he is like to have. For you must know, that after the business came to be noised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, the House is never empty of one or other in hopes to be Invited to the Wedding.</p>
               <p>All this while the Plasterer, Joiner, and Painter, are at work at the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart's own House, to new furbish the Shop, the Bed-Chamber and Dineing-Room; to repair the Wainscot, and Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the Stair-case and Chimney-peices. And least any thing should be a-miss, he brings home his Darling to direct the Work-men, and to see that all things be done according to her mind. While she is there the Upholsterer is also sent for to measure the Room, and to contrive the standing of the Bed-stead. And at the same time she orders what Hangings she will have; bids him bring her Patterns for the Curtains and Valence, referring the rest till she comes to his Shop her self. Nor must she go empty away neither; there's a Treatment attends her; outcomes the Silver Tankard, two Bottles of White-Wine, a Plate of Sugar, with a Silver Spoon, the best Pewter Dish in his Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, and four cold Chicken, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for Batchellors fare; but hoping with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that things will be better when she comes to have the management of Affairs.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43678:21"/> Upon which she gives him a gracious smile, and he remains the most satisfy'd person in the World: Certainly no man can think but that there must be a great deal of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in all this.</p>
               <p>Then he carries her home agen, where they are both stay'd for, by Mrs. <hi>Prittle-prattle,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Twittle-Twattle,</hi> who long to see Mr. <hi>Bridegroom</hi> Elect; that they may be able to spend their Judgments, as they walk home together. Well — and when's the day, crys one; when's the day, crys another. Laud—if I was so near it, crys a third; I should never be at rest, till the business were over: Not so fast, (quo the Mother,) I don't intend to marry my Daughter in hugger-mugger—I'll have her Marry'd like my Child—not among the Rabble at the <hi>Minories</hi>—but with a Licence, beshrew my Heart, yet not at our own Parish Church neither—for that's too near to make any show as we ride a long. Truly Madam, crys Mrs. <hi>Prit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-prattle,</hi> you do very well—I like none of your stolen Weddings, not I — For it may so happen that the Parson may dye, before I may think of geting of a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate—and then if my Husband and I should fall out, and he should deny me to be his Wife, in what a pickle must I be?
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43678:22"/> No, no, Madam, you act prudently; make a publick Wedding, and then all will be safe, according to the Proverb, <hi>fast bind, fast find.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the young Gentleman takes upon him to call the Maid, for he has in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner two homes for the present; and bids her bring a Bottle of Sack, Straight up comes the Maid with a Bottle, a clean Glass, and a Diaper Napkin, and the Mother drinks to Mrs. <hi>Prittle-prattle;</hi> Mrs. <hi>Prit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-prattle</hi> presents her service to the young Gentleman, and wishing him all happiness; holds up her Dagger-hand, and tosses all up. The Gentleman drinks to Mrs. <hi>Twittle-twat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Twittle-twattle</hi> Curchees to the young Lady, commends her choice▪ wishes herself a Widow, that she might choose for her too; and then takes off her Liquor: but for the young Lady she only sipps, and sets down the <hi>Glass.</hi> Now methinks, these are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pretty pass-times for a young Man—Hang Shop-keeping for five or six Months—The Portion will pay for loss of time, or else 'tis a hard Bargain.</p>
               <p>But Heavens bless us! there's a great deal more pleasure yet to come. For the young Man must still continue his visits, as a duty incumbent: he must visi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43678:22"/> the next, nay I know not how many nexts: But that's not a Straw mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for every next day has still new plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures attending it. Nay it may so happen, that the very next day, he's no sooner popp'd in a doors, but he sees several Bags of Money carried up Stairs; call'd in from the Scrivener to pay his Wives Portion. Cuds-foot, that's a pleasure indeed. Then he runs up Stairs into his Mistresses Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, kisses her and smuggles her agen and agen; and asks her what Service she has to command him that day? Perhaps he finds her a Bed, and then he kisses her a Bed, and that's another pleasure; she bids him go into the Kitchin, and she'll come to him presently—So away he goes and provides her a Mornings draught against she comes down. Presently, down she comes; and the Mother, and Daughter, and he, drink all three together. For the Father is a man of business, and leaves all to the discretion of his sober Wife.</p>
               <p>Now I'll say that for this Lady, and a Figg for her, she did not, to try his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, enjoin him a tedious Journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> for new Modes, and new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion'd Stuffs—she did not send him Galloping about the Country, for impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dainties against her Wedding Dinner;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43678:23"/> nor did she Capitulate with him, for Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority; nor did she aim at it, that I ever heard of, like the <hi>Northern</hi> Lady, tho' she went without it, because she met with her Match. There was a certain <hi>Northern</hi> Knight, who being young, brave, brisk, and Heir to his Father, had several Matches proposed to him. Among the rest he had the offer of two Sisters. What their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; (quo he,) So—(quo they.) What their Conditions? Why truly, the Eldest was of a disposition very haughty, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious, but very handsome; the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger mild and gentle, but otherwise indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Gad, (quo he) if any of the two, the Eldest and the handsomest, let her be the Devil. Away he rides, see's her, likes her, Courts her, and concludes the Match. But Madam, (quo he) before we go to Church, there is one agreement to be made between us. I understand your humour, and therefore pray, Madam, let us be at a certainty: Will you Reign Lady Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount the first year, and obey me all the rest of your life; or shall I command the first year, and all my days afterward be your Vassal? The young Fire-drake believing that if she got the start of him the first year, she should easily rule the roast all the rest of her Time, made answer, she would
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43678:23"/> be Empress the first Year—Content, (quo the Knight) and so they went to <hi>for better for worse,</hi> and were Marry'd. But she had better have chosen the last Proposition. For it cost her three of her Teeth, for think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Exercise her Authority after her time was expir'd. 'Tis true, the Lady play'd the Devil with two sticks during her year, but the Knight had the pleasure all the while to think how he should nick her when it came to his turn. And so he did with a vengeance, and made her one of the most obedient Wives afterwards in all the whole County; and that was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleasure to him as long as he liv'd.</p>
               <p>But this Lady did not lay any such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Impositions upon her design'd Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. She only sent him for Patterns of Silks, Gold and Silver Laces and Ribbands, or else order'd him to attend her to <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noster-Row,</hi> and the <hi>Exchange,</hi> to make her own Choice; which was all the while a Pleasure to him to be always in his Mistres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses presence, and to find how fond she was of him, that she could not endure him out of her sight.</p>
               <p>Well—and when they came home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, was it not a great pleasure to be ask'd his Advice, which Stuff, or which Lace, he lik'd best? And then he brings her the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43678:24"/> Patterns of his Cloth and his Buttons, and asks her which she likes best? After that, he carries her abroad to help him to buy his Cravats and his Linen: And at last, he likes what she buys, and she likes what he chooses, and so there's an unanimous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and Harmony between 'em, which of necessity must be the greatest pleasure ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. You cannot imagine what a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure some men take in spending their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to little purpose; but if they take a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in so doing, they have the pleasure of it, and what's that to any Body.</p>
               <p>After this she gives him the Names of her intended Bride-Maids, and what other Young Gentlewomen she will have at the Wedding. On the other side, he gives her the Names of his Bride-Men, and a List of what Friends he desires to grace the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. For (quo he) there will be Dancing, and 'tis fit the number of Males and Females should be equal, lest any of the Gentlewomen should take Pepper i' the Nose for being forc'd to sit still for want of Company. 'Tis very true, (quo she) and I believe, it will be taken the more kindly, if you go about and invite them your self. Here is no Compulsion, but still the pleasure of obeying the gentle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of a Complaisant Mistress; the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43678:24"/> of appearing trim to his own and his Mistresses Friends, and the pleasure of carrying them the News of his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happiness.</p>
               <p>Well—away he trots, and methinks I see him trip so lightly, and with so much pleasure and gaiety in his Countenance, that I cannot but severely blame the Disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of those that Scandalize this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Labour, as a Drudgery, and wearing out of Shooe-leather. As if a Man could think it a trouble, or grudge a little pains to gratifie the Requests of a kind Mistress. Some cry out, he may thence conjecture if he be not a Fool, what he must trust to hereafter. But I say there's no such dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Consequence. For the <hi>Penny-Post</hi> will serve at other times; but upon such a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous occasion as this, 'tis fit the young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman should do his own Errands himself. Besides that, if the Portion be a good round Sum, I think he's well paid for his pains.</p>
               <p>You may be sure he does not go for the Taylor nor the Sempstress, they come with a Whistle; a Porter will fetch them with a Vengeance. And here's another plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure attends him, to find so many People of all Trades courting his Custom, and to observe the discretion and prudent Thrift of his Mistress in driving her Bargains with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43678:25"/> every one. A certain sign of a saving Wise, and a plain Demonstration that she's no Fool to be chous'd of her Money, which cannot choose but be a great pleasure to him.</p>
               <p>Within three or four days the Taylor brings home the Wedding Cloaths; at what time the young Lady tries them on. Heavens! What a sight is there? The young <hi>Inamorato</hi> is surpriz'd to behold her, tho' but in half her Splendour; he scarce can think her to be a Mortal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and blesses himself that he does not live in the time when the Heathenish Gods were such Whore-Masters as they were. Hold a blow, <hi>Jupiter,</hi> quo he to himself, your Dancing Days are done, thanks to my good Stars; else certainly such an <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropa</hi> as this could ne'er have scap'd your Celestial Embraces, and I had been the unhappiest Person in the World. But the Gown being on; several faults are found by the Spectators: Here is a Pleight laid amiss; or it sits too full i' the Shoulders, and makes her look Hunch-back'd; or it is too big in the Waste: for you must know the Lady's naturally so slender you may span her with both hands; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded Bungler of a Taylor would needs be sowing in Bolsters a little above her
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43678:25"/> left Hip to hide Deformities where there were none. This puts the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman into a kind of a Fret, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the young Gentleman to break forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a kind of a Passion—Cuds-foot, quo he to the Taylor, Where were your Eyes? To which the Taylor pleading, that the Bolster was no bigger than a Wall-nut, and that most Ladies went in a little more or less in that part—Pox take your Wall-nuts, quo the young Hector, does this Lady look as if she wanted Wall-nuts in her sides: Pray take out your Wall-nuts again, and do your Work as you should do Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man like, or I'll make you stay for your Money till next years Wall-nuts are Ripe. With that the Cloths are pull'd off again, and they fall to measuring the Lace, and find wanting from the Petticoat, a Yard and a half, and about two Yards from the Skirt of the Gown. This puts the Lady in a Dumps: the Gentleman to please her, talks of nothing but entring his Action, and swears he'll spend the worth of the Gown but he'll make poor Prick-Louse an Example. But the Taylor telling them he had the rest at home, only he forgot to bring it, all's well again.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:43678:26"/>
               <p>Now this is the only vexation, let ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious people say what they can, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I could find attended a young Wooer before Marriage. However it begets an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other new pleasure, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r exceeding the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer disturbance. For the young Wooer cannot but be highly pleased, to find an occasion given to shew his zeal to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, and his readiness to revenge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done her, by the Son of a Whore Taylor; and to shew her likewise, that he could contain his Anger within the bounds of Moderation: For some young Gentlemen would have cut the Taylors Ears off, and flung the Wedding Cloths i'the Fire. But what would the young Lady have said then? This Gentleman's too hot for me; if he throw my Cloths i'the Fire already, what will he do when he has me? I'll recoil in time. Therefore the young Gentleman did prudently, and he that Acts prudently, must always be pleas'd with what he does, because he finds the good Effects of it.</p>
               <p>'Tis true there is a little Contention and petty brangling sometimes between the intended Bride-maids, about dressing up the Bridal Bed: But that's the greatest pleasure in the World to behold; while the young Wooer observes the care of his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43678:26"/> Friends, that all things within their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement, be done for the best, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving all occasions of censure and Twittle-twattle. For suppose one of the Bride-maids should be for Yellow Ribbands, and carry it: Fie, cries one, what a Colour is here? I never saw a Bridal Bed drest up with the Emblem of Jealousie before. Then <hi>Fueil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemort</hi> is propounded: A Laud—Sister, cries the t'other Bride-maid; that's more ridiculous by half, to prank up a Nuptial Bed with <hi>Fading Love.</hi> I am for <hi>True Blew;</hi> that signifies <hi>Constancy,</hi> and <hi>Green</hi> denotes <hi>Youth;</hi> put 'em both together, and theres <hi>Youthful Constancy:</hi> Or else i'my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, now I have it; what think you of <hi>Blew and Black?</hi> that signifies <hi>Constancy till Death.</hi> Shaw-waw, Sister, cries t'other Bride-maid, those Colours will never match: Besides, <hi>Green</hi>'s a <hi>Melancholy</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; nay, I have heard of <hi>Green</hi> Choler too, and that's the worst Choler of all. Fie, fie, I don't like <hi>Green</hi> by no means: But the other replying, that she meant <hi>Grass-Green,</hi> which signifies <hi>Youth and Jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> the t'other was contented that Colour should stand for one; with which, when the younger Bride-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aid propounded to mix a <hi>Violet. Violet!</hi> quo the Elder, that's as Extravagnat, for <hi>Violet</hi> signifies <hi>Religion:</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:43678:27"/> Now I'd fain know what young Married people have to do with <hi>Religion</hi> a Bed. At last they concluded to mingle a Gold Tis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, with the <hi>Grass-green,</hi> and so that chare was char'd.</p>
               <p>But the strife was much greater about the choice of the Favours; upon which there arose a very great dispute. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a Millener is sent for to be of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, and give his Advice. The Bride her self proposes <hi>Blew, Gold Colour, Popingay-Green,</hi> and <hi>Limon Colour;</hi> which is also highly applauded by the Bridegroom, out of a generous condescention to please her in all things, but the Millener objected against <hi>Gold Colour,</hi> as signifying <hi>Avarice,</hi> and <hi>Poppingay-Green,</hi> as denoting <hi>Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Marry, I don't like your Exception against <hi>Popingay-Green,</hi> quo the Elder Bride-maid: For <hi>Wantonness</hi> is as natural to new marry'd People, as to young Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens—I would not give a Farthing for a young Husband that would not be <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> nay as <hi>Wanton</hi> as a young <hi>Colt:</hi> And therefore my opinion is, that <hi>Popingay-Green,</hi> as a Colour that gives good Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to young married people, is not to be left out. As for the <hi>Gold Colour</hi> indeed if it signifie <hi>Avaries,</hi> away with it; for I hate a Covetous Husband. Well, but
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43678:27"/> since there is such variety in Colours; quo the Younger Bride-maid let me propose a mixture: What think ye of <hi>Flame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Flesh Colour, Willow</hi> and <hi>Milk-White?</hi> As for <hi>Flame Colour,</hi> quo the Millener, you have hit upon't extreamly well; for it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>Beauty and Desire:</hi> but <hi>Flesh Colour,</hi> signifies <hi>Lasciviousness,</hi> and <hi>Willow, Forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi> Away with those two last Colours, quo the Elder Bride-mald—Cuds-foot, tho' I love <hi>Wantonness,</hi> I hate <hi>Lasciviousness</hi>— And then again, it would be a rudeness to give <hi>Forsaken,</hi> to so many young Ladies and Gentlemen, in the prime of their years. Keep the <hi>White</hi> then, and the <hi>Flame Colour,</hi> and put in <hi>Red</hi> and <hi>Sea-Green.</hi> The <hi>Red</hi> is well enough, quo the Millener, for it signifies <hi>Justice;</hi> but <hi>Sea-Green</hi> signifies <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy:</hi> Let the <hi>Sea-Green</hi> serve, (quo the younger Bride-maid) for the <hi>Top-knots;</hi> it may become some Women well enough. But for the <hi>Red,</hi> I hold it extraordinary sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant for our purpose. For if a young man Marry a young Woman, and don't do her <hi>Justice,</hi> he ought to be casheer'd out of the Society of Women. Let me see— <hi>Red</hi> shall stand—and what think ye then of adding to it, <hi>Maidens-Blush, Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Peach Colour?</hi> As for <hi>Peach Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> Madam, (quo the Millener) 'tis well
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43678:28"/> thought of—but for <hi>Maidens-Blush,</hi> it signifies <hi>Envy,</hi> and <hi>Carnation Deceit;</hi> which indeed might be proper enough, if the person to be Marry'd were a Widow, but for young Virgins, that are not arriv'd at those qualities that raign in Riper years; I think with submission they are not so convenient. Come, come, (quo the Elder Bride-maid) keep the <hi>Maidens-Blush</hi> out of the Brides <hi>Top-knot,</hi> and I think we may wear it without offence: For I fear the best of us all, will envy her in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, for being Married before us. Sister (quo the younger Bride-maid,) I am afraid we shall never hit it, and therefore we were better refer it to the Millener him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. The Millener therefore being request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to shew his skill, propos'd for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, <hi>Blew, Red, Peach Colour,</hi> &amp; <hi>Orange Taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:</hi> For the young Ladies <hi>Top-knots, Flame-Colour, Straw Colour,</hi> signifying <hi>Plenty, Peach Colour, Grass-Green</hi> and <hi>Milk-White;</hi> and for the <hi>Garters</hi> a <hi>perfect Yellow,</hi> signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Honour and Joy;</hi> and so the debate ended.</p>
               <p>Now, do you think it was not a great pleasure to hear all these Learned discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses upon the various signification's of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours? Do you think it was not a great Pleasure to him, to think that the people should read the Ingenuity of his Bride,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43678:28"/> (for all will be thought to be her contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance) in the very Hats of her Attendants? and discover the Innocence, the Love, the Hopes, the Fertility, and Conjugal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of his Youthful choice in her very <hi>Top knots:</hi> Hang me if I know what ye call pleasures of Wooing, if you deny these to be Pleasures.</p>
               <p>Now help me, O ye nine, <hi>Polyhymne, Melpomene, Clio,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conian</hi> Gang—yet, why do I invoke a Company of stale Wenches, that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Married i'their Lives? rather assist me <hi>Venus, Hymen,</hi> and <hi>Apollo;</hi> to declare those unutterable pleasures that are to ensue: For now the Sun with early beams begins to gild the happy Morning, appointed for the publick Ceremony. Up starts the watchful Bridegroom, to dress himself in all his gaudy Trim. The Bride-maids, that had no time to sleep for washing of their Silver Necks, and pranking up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, ready betimes, make hast to the Brides Chamber; where they find her Wash'd and Bath'd, breathing nothing but Essence of Oranges and Jessamine; her fine lac'd <hi>Holland</hi> Smock newly put on, ready for their Virgin diligence. Straight all hands to work; first this, then that, then another fine Gewgaw; till at length
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43678:29"/> attir'd in all her Glory, she ceases to be Mortal, and appears all Angel. Presently whirl'd in his Coach, comes the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, perfuming all the House with his <hi>Roman</hi> Gloves; asks for the Bride, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up into her Chamber, with a submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Knee, adores his Deity, kisses the Lilies of her Hand, sips Nectar from her Lips for his mornings draught, and then conducts her down into the Room of State, where both prepared stand to welcom their Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Guests, that drop in as it were all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with unanimous Watches in their Pockets, so careful were they to observe the hour.</p>
               <p>Thus all things ready, all in comely Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they take <hi>Coach,</hi> environ'd with a throng of Starers and Gapers, that will hardly permit the Horses to go along. There's a pretty Couple, cries one—there's a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Couple, cries another—there will be sweet work at night, cries a Third—The Shops are all full of Night-rails—and what Wedding's this? and whose Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding's this? The Rabble runs wondring, and the Dogs run barking; but the City Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal riding before, keeps all off, till the Church doors are shut.</p>
               <p>After a short stay, out they come again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; at what time the Beggars
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43678:29"/> give him Joy; and then the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, for the Grandeur of the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, throws 'em a small handful of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Money, and sets 'em all a Scrambling. So taking Coach again, they all return home as they came, or else to some Hall, with the same Rabble at their Heels as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them to Church. Now it is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to be attended by the Rabble; 'tis a Mark of Greatness; Great Men count it a great Happiness to be Popular. You see the Bridegroom was resolv'd to make a shew; should the Rabble then have been sullen, and not come forth to have seen it, all his Money had been thrown away, and he had lost the pleasure of his Expence. But the Rabble were kind, and gratify'd his Expectations, which in my opinion, could not but be an undoubted Pleasure to any Man that thinks it a pleasure to make a shew of himself.</p>
               <p>Now you must suppose the Father and the Mother, the Bride, and the Bridegroom, to be all in a great Hall, or a great Room all together, in expectation of a great Dinner. The Guests are all to Salute the Bride, and the Bridegroom is to Salute all the Young Gentlewomen. And I think there's a great deal of Pleasure in that too: I dare say,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43678:30"/> were he to lie with 'em all at Night, he'd find less Pleasure in that, than in Kissing 'em all at Noon. Nor is there less pleasure in receiving the kind Wishes of Happiness and Prosperity, whole Bushels and Sacks full from such a Glorious Assembly. They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>emember his Father was no Retailer of a Tradesman, and therefore they pour their Benedictions upon him by Whole-sale. Nor is the Bridegroom a Clown—Come, Gentlemen, quo he, What do ye think of a Whet before Dinner; 'tis the Fashion now adays; from the Church to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern. With that he begins a Bumper, and sees it go round, more especially among the Men; for the Women are spar'd as the Weaker Vessels. There are two Bride-Maids, and therefore he begins t'other Glass; and when that has gone round, is just laying his Hand upon a third, but his Bride desires him not to Drink too much before Dinner, for fear of spoiling his Stomach.</p>
               <p>But what? Is there no Discourse among 'em? Little to the purpose as yet—that's all to come—People never begin to Talk you know, till their Belly's are half full —Hark—What's the matter now? The Shaumes, the Shaumes— Dinner's
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43678:30"/> coming up—and by and by the Dishes are Marshall'd with as much formality as at a Lord Mayor's Feast. At what time, the Knot-knitter having said Grace, they all take their places according to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents degree i' the Parish; the Alderman's Son above the Common-Council Mans; the Common-Council Man's above the Church Wardens, and so forth; the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom at the lower end of the Table: They are so exact, there need's do Herauld to place 'em: And so fall on, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>I shall not need to tell ye, Gentlemen, what pleasure a Bridegroom may take in eating; you all know it well enough; but it cannot choose but be a great pleasure to see all the Table Address their Glasses first to his Bride and then to him, for it is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Mark of their respect to him and his Bride: Upon which, there attends ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very great pleasure to the Bridegroom if he can but keep himself sober till he goes to Bed. I will not say there passes much Discourse during the first Course; the second produces more; for toward the end of that, a Grave Gentleman, with a Jolly Red Nose, the Brides Father's Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and Fellow Clubber at the Tavern
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43678:31"/> for his Evenings Draught, begins an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue in praise of Marriage. He tells the Company that Marriage was first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Paradise. At which the Religious young Men all pull off their Hats. He tells 'em that Marriage is that, without which the Church would want Pastors, and Kingdoms their defence. He tells 'em that Children are the Blessings of Heaven, and that the Jewish Women accounted Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the greatest Scandal in the World. Ay, and so do the <hi>English</hi> Women too, cry'd a Grave Matron Midwife, and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociate to the Bride's Mother (for such sort of Cattle as they will crowd in if possible upon such occasions) and I should be sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as well for my own as my young Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses sake, that she should prove Barren. For I hope to carry her first Boy to the Font as old as I am. For my own part I had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven Children in eight years; and I dare say my young Mistress is as likely as I, if my young Master be as well provided as my Husband; which I make no question but that he is. This Interruption being over, the Grave Gentleman went on, and told 'em that Marriage was not only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed by the <hi>Christians,</hi> but <hi>Pagans</hi> also, and how that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> Instituted
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43678:31"/> a great Festival, where all Men that were not Marry'd before Twenty, were to be Whipt by the Women as Drones, and Persons not fit to serve the Common-Wealth. And how that the <hi>Romans</hi> crown'd the Foreheads of those that had been seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times Marry'd, with Garlands of Palm-Tree. He would have gone on, but that he spy'd a Warden-Pye that made Water in his Mouth, and caus'd him to conclude his Discourse. The Midwife glad of the Opportunity, resolv'd to set a new Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course abroach. To which purpose, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing her self to the Grave Gentleman, Sir (quo she) which do you think to be the fittest Age for two young Couple to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at? But the Gentleman returning no Answer, because his Mouth was full of Crust and Pear—Why then, young Gentlemen, and Ladies, all that are present, mark my Words—I knew a young Man, that got a Maid with Child at nine years of Age. You may call him a Boy, because he was so young; but I call him a Man because he got a Child. Mother, quo a brisk Lad at the Table, I am afraid, the Maid had some other help besides the young Man of Nine years of Age: and with that they all fell a Laughing; nay,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43678:32"/> Mrs. <hi>Bride</hi> her self was forc'd to pull down her Hood over her Eyes. Gentlemen, quo the Midwife, let them Laugh that win, but the Story's as true as that I take off this Glass; and so here's to ye all Ladies and Gentlemen, and send ye good luck. Nay, more than that, setting down her Glass, I have heard of another that at Ten years of Age got his Nurse with Child. And I have a good Author for what I say, if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a very good Scholar that told me the Story be true; Lau-ye now. And therefore I would advise all Marry'd Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not to let their young Children, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Sisters lie together, as frequently they do, because they look upon 'em to be but Boys and Girls. If what I have said may seem strange, I am sure all Physicians will allow this, that Maids are ripe at Fourteen, and Men at Seventeen: After that Age both Sexes hone after Wedlock, or something else, and therefore, said a wise Friend of mine, Marry your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters betimes, or they'll Marry themselves. You may think I speak to promote my own Trade, but I protest, Ladies, and Gentlemen, I speak cordially what I think.</p>

               <p>Certainly this Discourse must be a very great pleasure to the young Bridegroom; first, to hear the State of Matrimony into which he was now enter'd, so highly commended by a Grave and Experienc'd Gentleman; and secondly to hear such an Ample Testimony giv'n of his Wives Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by a Sober Matron, who had known her from her Infancy: But above all, he could not choose but be pleas'd to hear there were such great Pleasures in M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We will suppose Dinner now over, the Cloth taken away, and all upon their Legs; at what time the Midwife coming up to the Bridegroom, and Whispering him in the Ear, Son (quo she) for <hi>a Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denhead,</hi> I'll warrant thee, Boy: But crop the Flower gently, for fear of pulling up the whole Plant by the Roots— Then leading him to the Bride— Now the

               <p>After all these pleasures, comes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of all felicity: The Bride and the Bridegroom are put to Bed. But let his Concupiscence be never so Rampant, he must have a little patience, but the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure will recompense it. For the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany know they are never more to see their young play fellow in <hi>statu quo prius</hi> any more; and therefore now or never, they must come and take leave of the Brides Maiden-head.

               <p>And thus the two Lovers left alone, you may be sure the Bridegroom is not idle. Those Snowy Breasts, which lately he scarce durst lay his little Finger on, he now grasps by whole palmsfull; he has now free liberty to enjoy, what before his thoughts durst scarce approach without Guilt.</p>
               <p>But now let him wanton till he's wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or rather till the Mother and the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife come to visit him next morning, and see how her Daughter does. Which they are as sure to do as the Sun shines; they have been at the sport themselves, and therefore know what's good to repair the losses in Venereal Combats. Well, Son, how is it? quo the Mother; never better, cries the Bridegroom, and with that she reaches him a Plate of <hi>Eringo's</hi> to give his Bride, and eat himself; then she fills out a full bowl of Tent, with a new Egg in it, which the Bridegroom mannerly presenting to his darling delight, the Mother fills him out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of the same. The Bride has no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner drank but the Midwife is at her with a whisper in the Ear to tell—to which, for that time, the young Lady answers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a Blush. But the Bridegroom gues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing at the purport of the Question, Oh, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Upon that the Mother and the Midwife go forth again and leave the young couple alone as they found 'em. Who both conclude to take a short napp to digest their mornings draught and encouraging Breakfast; but no sooner are Male and Female clasp'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, when first come the Fidlers and scrape him a wicked <hi>Reveillez:</hi> the Drums rattle; the Shaumes tote, the Trumpets sound <hi>Tan ta ra ra ra;</hi> and the whole Street rings with the Benedictions and good wishes of Fidlers, Drummers, Pipers and Trumpetters. You may safely say now the Wedding's proclaim'd. In the midst of which noise, the Bridegroom, unwilling to pay his Musick for nothing, gets up and dances to as many of their Tunes as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, and oppportunity will give him leave. Now is not this a blessed time? Here are no less than all Four Sences pleased at a time, Feeling, Seeing, Hearing and Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and for the Fifth of Tasting, it had it's turn but a little before. And thus for a whole Week together nothing but Mirth and Jollity, nothing but visiting and being visited, besides a great Entertainment gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43678:35"/> by the two Bride-men at some emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Tavern or other; till time at length joggs the Bridegroom by the Elbow, and tells him 'tis time to look after his worldly Affairs.</p>
               <p>Now some there are that laugh at all this pomp and publick Ceremony, say that Fools and their money were soon parted; and that 'tis the only way for a man so to habituate his Wife to pleasure, that 'twill be a hard matter to wean her from it: And therefore there are some that have money enough, yet so much prudence to boot, that after they are agreed, without troubling Taylors for new Cloths, or Semp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses for new Linen, sneak to Church by themselves, sneak to a Tavern by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, make a Wedding dinner by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, upon a <hi>French</hi> Roll, and a Bottle of Claret, then sneak to Bed by themselves; and so there's a great deal of money sav'd, and the Fidlers disappointed to boot. 'Tis a bad sign when a young man is forc'd to tap his Portion, to buoy up his Wedding Gallantry; for many times the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self can hardly get in the Spiggot again.</p>
               <p>But to this I say, let every man do as he pleases, and he will be sure to be pleas'd. All men have their Humours; and he that has his Humour, has his pleasure. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43678:36"/> this is certain, the pleasures of Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Wooing are far more numerous than those of Stingy Courtship. All men are not Born <hi>Croesus</hi>'s; nor have all men mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney nor time to keep open house; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Journey-man Carpenter that rose early all the Week long and therefore Marry'd his Wife of a <hi>Saturday,</hi> made a good answer to them that ask'd him, why he Marry'd of a <hi>Saturday;</hi> because, (said he) I might lie the longer a Bed with my Wife a <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning. Tis not for a Prentice that Marries before he's out of his time, to proclaim his Wedding; yet the stolen pleasure, of a Wife laid up in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender, must of necessity be very sweet; besides the pleasure of putting a daily cheat upon the World, who believe him a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor, when perhaps he has two or three Children. So that let a Man be Rich or Poor, Prodigal or Covetous; there is both pleasure in Wooing, and pleasure in Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, contrary to that damnable posit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>III.</hi> Of House-Keeping Expence: Together with several pleasant Digressions.</head>
               <p>HOW do you say Friend, is there no pleasure in House-keeping? 'Tis a bold Assertion, and you shall hear more of it by and by. For now I think on't, my young married Couple are still at the Wives Parent's; and I must go fetch 'em home, before they get a habit of Rambling.</p>
               <p>But that's done to my hand; for time as I said before has given the young Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom an <hi>Item</hi> in private, that the hours have wings, and that Pags will grow Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty, unless fill'd again. Thereupon, abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pleasures and Hony-moon delights, and that's the greatest pleasure in the World, for a man to be able to deny himself; he brings home his Wife, puts on his Ordinary Weeds, and begins to consider what he has to do. And I hope there's never a <hi>Manichaeon</hi> of 'em all, but will confess it to be a very great pleasure to a man to look after his own business; and if he sees his Wife no less diligent in her Station, that's as great a pleasure as any can be. There is no man in the World so silly, but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he goes about to Marry, he has so much insight into the World, as to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43678:37"/> know, that the best House-wife in Nature, can never be able to shew her Art, her Education, and her House-wifery, upon bare Walls. 'Tis a thousand pound to a penny, but that in his Batchellour visits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he Married her, he might see he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> sometimes with her slender Fingers pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up an Apple Tar; or more industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously labouring to make the sides of a Goose-Pye stand; and in the midst of this her House-wifely Employment, calling for this and that Kitchin Utensil, as she want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, by hard names that were all <hi>Heathen Greek</hi> to him. Or else at another time, he might perhaps behold her with a Silver Ladle, Scumming off the Froth from a Pipkin of Damascon's, which she was Preserving over the Fire, or else more laboriously tiring her self to make Rasberry Brandy. And then 'twas his time to have consider'd, whether such a Wife were convenient for him or no. For he might be sure, what was bred in the Bone would never out of the Flesh; as she had been bred, so she would expect to be maintain'd. He saw how her Mothers House was furnished; the Kitchin full of Brass and Pewter; the Parlour, and Dine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Room nearly accoutr'd, and all things trimm and proper above Stairs: and could
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43678:37"/> he think but that when she was his Wife, she would look for the same in her own House? I would fain know, which a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional man would take for the greater pleasure, to see his Wife always industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously imployed at home, or never at home but a Nights, and that not till the Watch cries, Past twelve a Clock neither; but still whip out a doors, as soon as she gets dress'd, and spending her time at the Play-houses, or else losing money at Cards, at this or that Gossip's House, where she finds Company most suitable to her Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, there are some men that take it for a great pleasure, to bring their new Marry'd Wives to a House ready furnish'd before hand. But others more Indulgent please themselves in believing it much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; to spare that trouble, till they are Married, and is much more satisfy'd that he has an Opportunity to let his Wife have the Liberty to please her self; believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it is but reason, that she, being us'd to it, has more experience to know what she wants, than he can pretend to. Now there is no Woman i'the World can shew her House-wifery, and her Ingenuity in a House where there is nothng but bare Walls. <hi>They that go a borrowing, go a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing,</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:43678:38"/> says the Proverb. That Woman's in an ill Condition, that must be forced to send to her Neighbours for every Skillet, or Stew-pan, or Washing-Tub she wants, which are many times deny'd, and as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently lent with an ill will. But she that has all things necessary about her, need ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be beholding to her Neighbours. And therefore in my Opinion, it ought to be so far from being an ungrateful Sound, that it should be like the Musick of St. <hi>Pulchres</hi> Chimes in his Ears, when his Wife asks him for money to buy necessaries. If she aim to be a little more gay and sumptuous than ordinary; that ought to be another pleasure to him: For the best is best cheap. She becomes the Envy of her Neighbours that come to visit her, and her Reputation runs through the Parish like Wild-fire. The brightness of the Bosses of her Fire-Irons, and the Glaring Lustre of her Pewter and Preserving-Pan are the Discourse of all her Acquaintance; the sleekness of her rubb'd Rooms, and the cleanly neatness of her Carpets, Chairs and Stools, with their Frames rubb'd as slick as the Toe of a new shooe, are spread abroad to her never dying Honour. All which must certainly be a very great pleasure to a Husband. And then again when Houshold Goods are
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43678:38"/> once bought, there's an end of that Story: Good House-wifery and Management, makes every thing last long; or if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that there must be an Exchange, now and then, the Expence is insensible, but the supply is obvious and remarkable. What a Pox should a Woman give three and four pounds a year, to a couple of massie fat Buttock'd Queans, but to keep all things Tite and Cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nly, one above Stairs, and t'other below? 'Tis the Humour of men to love Cleanliness, but they do not love to be within when there is any Scrubbing or Washing work to be done; they do not love holes in the heels of their Stockings, nor their Ruffles to hang like Bell-ropes; but they scorn to set a stitch to mend 'em themselves. If then the Wife will take the trouble upon her to see all these inconveniencies remedy'd her self, surely it ought to be a very great pleasure to a man. Nor is it a <hi>Venice</hi> Looking-Glass, a little <hi>China</hi> ware, a <hi>Persian</hi> Carpet; two or three Pictures, or an <hi>Indian</hi> Cabinet, that ought to break squares between a Man and his Wife. And then for Plate, the more he has the Richer he is. Rather it ought to be a great pleasure to a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that his Wife requires nothing from him, but what redounds to his Honour.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43678:39"/> For certainly the politeness and curiosity of a Woman adds greatly to the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Husband; and I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive that were it not for the little requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Pride and Vanity of Women, Men would be the most nasty Beasts and Slovens in the World. How like a Paradise such a ones House lies? cries one. It would do your Heart good but to look into the Rooms, cries another. And all judge that all this could never be, but that her Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Husband allows it: Which must needs greatly redound to his praise, nor can there be a greater pleasure than that which proceeds from Commendation. Nay if it were but for the wholesomness of it, and the prolongation of Life, who would not rather choose to live in a Palace of a Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, than in a Hog-stye of a House. In the one he see's the Rooms decently hung, the Beds sweet and clean, and the very Air it self purify'd by good House-wifery. In the other you find nothing but dirt to the Ankles; the And-irons rusty, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the Testern all full of Cob webs, that a man would be afraid to sleep with his Mouth open, for fear the Spiders should drop in it; go into the Mistresses Chamber, and the first Glance of your Eye, gives you the prospect of an open Close-stool,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43678:39"/> and a Chamber-pot full charged, as if the Woman thought all that came from her, were nothing but Civet and Essence of Orange Flowers. In the one a man lives with pleasure and delight; in the other he goes to his Grave, Poison'd with the stench of his Wife's nastiness.</p>
               <p>Another thing laid to the Womans Charge, is her lashing out in Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: As if it became a Woman of any Quality, to grudge her Friends when they come to see her, a Glass of Wine, and a Dish of Sweet-meats; which perhaps she was so good a House-wife as to make her self. The most Prodigal women will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give Treatments, but where they are sure to be Treated agen; and it is not to be thought that a Prudent and Thrifty wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will be less wary. If sometimes she shews her self generous to those that have been niggardly to her, it argues that she ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did it, to shew that she was better Marry'd than the other, or else to upbraid and shame that want of Civility, which the other had been guilty of. I'll warrant ye the same Woman shall never-tast of her Bounty twice together. I must confess 'tis no such infallible mark of a generous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to Entertain for the sake of being En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd again. Many Women do it to
<pb facs="tcp:43678:40"/> shew that they live in Plenty, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the Credit and consequently the pleasure of the Husband, and to merit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause themselves; which cannot but very much please a Husband when he hears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the good use which his Wife makes at home, of his Liberality. If a man meets with the vertue of Liberality in his Wife, he ought by no means to stifle it, for fear he meet with no more; for I look upon Chastity rather to be a Duty than a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: 'tis the temper of her Body that many times renders a Woman Chast; but it is the temper of her mind, that renders her Generous and Liberal. If a Woman lanch out one day for her Husbands Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and save three days after for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands profit, where's the Extragance so much to be complain'd of? Besides, if she be a Woman that makes those great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ainments you talk of, 'tis to be supposed she does not Junket in Hugger-mugger; and then the Husband may come in for his share, and take the pleasure of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. He that spends little abroad, and most at home, may well permit his Wife to entertain her Friends, now and then without prejudice to his Estate. The Wine tastes as well at home, as at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern; and a Capon may be as well dress'd
<pb facs="tcp:43678:40"/> in his own Kitchin, as at a <hi>French</hi> Ord'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; and I am sure with less expence. That a prudent Wife knows, and therefore is now and then, a little more than usually lavish at home, to draw her Husband into a good Opinion of his own House.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, there are several Extravagant young Coxcombs, that Marry Hand over Head; but Wedlock is not to be Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd and abus'd for the miscarriages of Fools. 'Tis not what men, that have any thing of reasonable foundation to fix upon, spend at home in Houshold-stuff and good Chear, that brings 'em to take out Duce's from the <hi>Counter</hi> to carry 'em to <hi>Ludgate,</hi> or <hi>Tipp-staff</hi> 'em over the Water, but their Marrying of Wives before they know how to maintain 'em. By their bouncing and cracking and huffing they get an Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Portion with an unwary Girl as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be marry'd as themselves; and while that lasts, they live like Princes; but when all's gone, they vanish too. Their Wives think 'em to be the same persons they seem to be, and are willing to live at the same port which their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands pretend to. An Ambition in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men no way to be discommended, rather laudable where there is an Estate to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it: but if her Husband deceive her,
<pb facs="tcp:43678:41"/>
'twas not the Wives Ambition to be equal with her Neighbours, nor her free Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of her Friends, and many times her Husband's Acquaintance as well as hers, that occasion'd the Dislocation of the whole Family; but the Folly of the Husband, who did not in time inform her of his Condition. So that the Man may be said to undo the Woman, but not the Woman to undo him.</p>
               <p>Nay suppose the Woman be bad, if the Man be so too; if the Woman be a spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift, if the Man be so to; why should the blame be laid upon Wedlock? 'Twas no fault in Matrimony; for, for ought I I see, they are both equally match'd: 'tis not the Yoak of Matrimony, that lies hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon the Man, but his own Folly and Vanity, that will not permit him to have any Government of himself, nor his Wife neither. The Woman's to be commended to make Hay while the Sun shines; you some and I some is but fair play; she sees her Portion a going, and there's all the reason i'the World she should spend her share, else 'twere a very hard case. The Woman is not to be blamed for spending her own, when she sees her Husband would spend it else for her. And when all's gone, let 'em go lovingly a begging together;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43678:41"/> and then the Man takes her again for <hi>poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> as he took her before for <hi>Richer;</hi> which still makes good the second Condition of Matrimony, without any Complaint of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side.</p>
               <p>But suppose the Woman be a Spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift, and the Husband as Miserable as Old <hi>Stretchley;</hi> yet is not Matrimony to be blamed in this Case neither. For a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Man would examine the Conditions of his Wife before he enters into Bands. If the Man will carry her to Church, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is to do his duty. Now I'll warrant you this was some <hi>Smithfield</hi> Bargain; this was some clutchfisted Hunks that would have the young Maid whether she would or no, and her Parents would force her to have him against her Will, and when she has him, she plays the Devil. Truly 'tis no more than he deserves; were all such Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial <hi>Barterers</hi> so condignly punished, there would be fewer than there are; and if there were none at all, 'twere not a half-penny matter.</p>
               <p>I must confess there is a general clamour against Matrimony, for the sake of Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Wives. But I say 'tis for the Honour of the Nation that Women should go fine. To see so many broad Laced Petticoats, so many sumptuous Manteaus, flaring with Flower
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43678:42"/> of Silver and Gold, marching through the Streets of <hi>London</hi> of a <hi>Sunday,</hi> shews the Riches of the Kingdom. A Chambermaid, whose whole Estate is only a light Porters Burthen in a Trunk of an ordinary size mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>A.F.</hi> if you see her upon a Holyday you cannot distinguish between her and the Mistress. Now all this Bravery must cost Money. And therefore it shews the Wealth of a Nation, that a Company of Men should export such vast summs of Gold to fetch in your <hi>Indian</hi> Riff-raff of unnecessary Silks and Cheats, and a world of other shitten-com-shites, and yet that there should remain so much Gold behind to purchase so much Gallantry. Then again, it is a great mark of the Vertue and Chastity of the <hi>English</hi> Women. For where there is much brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there is much Temptation. For your Glorious Petticoats inflame men with an ardent desire to understand what those hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Beauties are that lye concealed under so much Pomp and Gallantry. But if a hot cod-pieced Spark do but attempt to pick up one of these fine Birds in a duskie Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, what do they do? They give him a flap o' the Chaps, bid him go about his business, and tell him, They are no such Persons as he takes them for. There can be no greater pleasure to a Man than to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus, my beloved, 'tis not what your Wives spend at home in fine Cloathes and Houshold stuff, but what you your selves lavish away abroad in fine Gaming, fine Whoring, and fine Revelling: There goes the Hare away. If you have but vertuous Wives, keep close to them, and they'll keep close to you. And therefore never complain of Matrimony. For Wives are not imposed upon men, but chosen: choose a vertuous Wife, and she'll never desire more than her Husband is able to allow her.</p>

                  <hi>IV.</hi> Visiting Friends, and going into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with an Account of the Entertainment and pleasant Divertisements and Discourses thereupon.</head>
               <p>WHY look ye, Gentlemen, it was never esteemed a Crime that I know of, for a man to marry into a good Family, neither is there any one Statute in <hi>Polton</hi> against it. For Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do not come out of the Earth like Pompions; but their Pedigrees must have a beginning somewhere. The meanest Beggar as well as the greatest Lord had once an Original Father and Mother. But the Records of Descent are frequently lost,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43678:43"/> and more frequently not regarded; and as often Bloody Wars, and Invasions of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries extirpate whole Families: Lords are made Beggars, and Beggars are made Lords. He's a happy man now that can derive his Pedigree from <hi>William the Conqueror;</hi> tho' some Women, whose Husbands are great Antiquaries, will go a great deal farther at a Christning; and in the heat of Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when privity comes to be disputed, will derive themselves from the Eldest Maid of Honour, to <hi>Nimrod's</hi> Wife. But let that alone: Most certainly it may so happen, that a Man may Marry a Wife, that has a great many Relations that live i'the Country, and a Woman may Marry a Man that has as many. For if you ask a Citizen where he was Born, there's not one in Forty, but will cry in <hi>Glocestershire, Devonshire, Kent, Norfolk</hi> &amp;c. others in <hi>Wales;</hi> but very few make Answer, within the sound of <hi>Bow-bell.</hi> And this is apparent from the several County Feasts that meet every year, which were they all join'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, would beat the Cockneys into an Augur-hole. Now whether the Man, or Woman, or both, have these Relations in the Country, is not a Straw matter to the purpose, but this is certainly to be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin'd, that when a man is Marry'd, he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43678:43"/> will not conceal it, either from his own, or his Wives Friends: Who presently send back words that they should be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad to see both him and his Wife, or her and her Husband in the Country. Now the Wife out of Natural Affection is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to see her Friends, and the Man is no less Ambitious to shew his Wife: and thus when both are agreed, the pleasure of Marriage is in concerting both in the same Opinion. Perhaps there has been an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change between 'em of <hi>Turkeys, Geese, Cheeses</hi> and <hi>Bacon,</hi> for <hi>Sugar, Plumms,</hi> and <hi>Spice;</hi> perhaps one of the Kindred has had an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to come to Town, and has had the convenience of a Lodging at his new Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's House, for which he can do no less than invite the new Marry'd Couple into the Country to a dish of Keel and Bacon, and homely Apple-pye. Why Faith, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin, or Uncle, quo the young Man, we may chance to pop upon ye before y'are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware—I should be at <hi>Exeter</hi>-Fair, this <hi>Lammas-Tide</hi>—Cuds fish, (quo his Cousin) 'tis but a little out of your way, to ride to <hi>Dorchester,</hi> and then you come within a Mile of our House.</p>
               <p>Now suppose the young Man should be as good as his word, and resolve to give his Wife an Airing i'the Country. Why
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43678:44"/> should Marriage so inhumanly suffer for this? You may be sure, he will not Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel his Wife in Winter, nor in <hi>Easter</hi>-Term, and that's the chief Season of the year for Trading; therefore generally he chooses a very long <hi>Vacation.</hi> And what if he does, when there's little to do i'the Town; I say, what if he does take a frisk into the Country for a Month, or three Weeks, to visit his own or his Wives Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; especially having Servants whose Parents are bound for their Truth, to look after his Affairs in the mean time. Tho' the gentiler way would be to send her down before, with some Friend of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Attorney, a little before the <hi>Sizes,</hi> and for him to go after and fetch her home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And then, besides that she shall see the <hi>Sizes,</hi> and my Lords the Judges, he shall have the happiness of a new plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that he never enjoy'd before; which is to write lovingly to Her, and to receive endearing Answers from her again, with <hi>Dear,</hi> and <hi>Chuck,</hi> at the Top, and <hi>Thine till Death,</hi> and <hi>Thine Eternally</hi> at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. This is only if he have no other business in those Parts; but if he have bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness at any Remarkable Fair thereabouts: Let him then by any means attend her him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and Amble her easie <hi>Carriers Journey,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:43678:44"/> for fear of the Inconveniencies of weariness, and Stomach Qualms. For indeed, if there be any thing that affects Matrimony with Calumny in this Particular we are now upon, it is for a Man to be forc'd to alight to take down his Wife in the middle of a Heath, sick as a Horse, and ready to faint away in his Arms; or else to ride by the Coach and hear her groan, and by and by to see her throw up her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested Break-fast into her opposite Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Lap, while the confounded Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Yapps</hi> it away, as if he were driving for a Wager. These I must confess, are Accidents that somewhat Eclipse the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of his journey. But as Heaven would have it, a sup or two of Dr. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi>'s Water, sets her right again, and she holds it so; till they come to the next good Town, where they make a full stopp, take a fresh Bait, and perfect the Cure. Then 'tis a new Pleasure to him to see her again as crank as a young Goslin. The Women ask her how long she has been marry'd? She tells 'em so long; then they conclude she's a breeding, and all's forgiven.</p>

After a stay of three or four days, away Gallops the Husband thirty or forty Miles further about his business, and leaves his Wife and her Palfrey together, to be carry'd from place to place, to see and be seen; and still she has a Convoy of he Cousins and she Cousins to shew her the Country, and treat her at this and t'other good Town; they are never out of their way; for still she finds new Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Acquaintance, and all make much of the <hi>Londoner,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:43678:45"/>
               <p>Now where is the Felony all this while, that these <hi>Muggletonians</hi> lay to the Charge of Matrimony? Oh! the great charges the man is at to buy her an amb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Nagg, a swimming <hi>Pacer</hi> forsooth; or else Coach hire, and expences upon the Road, besides the Carriage of a great hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Trunk, where all the Finery lies. S'life, would they have had her Husband and she ha' walk'd down a Foot, with each a Snap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sack at their Backs, and lain among the Beggars in Barns by the way? would they have had her gone naked, or otherwise than like her self, as if she had gone a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, to be slighted and contemn'd by her Friends, and kickt out of doors? what would her Kindred have thought of such a shabby Couple? what would they have thought of her Husband? Surely they would have thought their Kinswoman well holpen up by her match; and look'd upon her Parents to have been a strange sort of People to let out their Daughter t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>What if the 'Prentices and the Maids do junket a little together? what if they do purloin three or four Bottles of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Wedding Wine, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43678:46"/> Sack-posset it now and then of an Evening? 'Tis pay'd for; and why should not the Servants be a little merry at home, as well as the Master abroad? I'll warrant you they were no such ill Servants, but that they drank their Master and Mistresses Health; and then they could never grutch it 'em. What if the 'Prentice where a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle familiar with the Chamber-maid? Let his Parents look to that; they are bound for his good behaviour. Must the Master be always oblig'd to stay at home to watch least his 'Prentice should lie with his Maid?</p>
               <p>But you'll say, he has no Trade nor Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men i'the Country—What then?—I'd fain know where he could have lived Cheaper for so long time than amongst his Friends, that every day feast him a free cost; only giving now and then a Shilling or two to the Servants.</p>
               <p>'Tis a shame that men should so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and bespatter Matrimony, when they have no better Objections against her than these. And yet they bawl and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour against her, as if Matrimony that gives all mankind their being, were like those ill natur'd Fowls, that destroy their Chickens as soon as they are hatch'd. A man cannot carry his Wife into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43678:46"/> nor can a VVife desire to see her Friends, but here's an Out-cry against Matrimony. Tho I dare be bold to say, there's none of these people that are so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere against VVedlock but would take it very ill to be call'd <hi>Sons of Whores,</hi> which had not their Fathers and Mothers been Marry'd, they must have been. As they are born then, they ought to speak well of Matrimony, and not quarrel with her for every trifle of a Side-Saddle, or Padd-Nag that a Man bestows upon his VVife.</p>
               <p>Well—but now suppose the Man and his Wife come home again; what does all the Charges amount to, perhaps some Twenty or Thirty Pound —a Monstrous Sum to damn Matrimony for. The Horse and the Padd-Nag yield their Money again; the Cloths are little or nothing the worse for wearing. It may be the Side-Saddle may be afterwards lent out among the Neighbours, and come home at length without the Stirrup, or the Bridle and that may have taken leave one of another; but that's but a small matter. If when they came home again, they had found the House remov'd a t'other side the Water, or the Furniture Pawn'd, or the Servants run away with all the Ware i'the Shop, these had been Losses indeed,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43678:47"/> that would have struck deep. But all's well, and the Woman so satisfy'd, that perhaps she never Dreams of such another Journey as long as she lives. A kind Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence only now contents, and it is a pleasure to her that she knows the places and the Persons to which, and to whom she directs her Letters.</p>
               <p>But you'll say, this brings another Charge upon her Husband, to entertain them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain when they come to the City about business. Let 'em come and welcome. Certainly 'tis a bad Trade that will not afford 'em a good Bed, and a good Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days Dinner be sure. That I'd have if I were the Wife, tho I Pawn'd my best Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoat for it. But what need that, the Man has a good Trade, lives plentifully, the Wife goes twice a Week to Market, and what signifies a Joint of Meat extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary upon an extraordinary Occasion? And if the Husband do carry his Friend to the Tavern and give him a Bottle or two of Wine, What Matrimonial Crime can that be?</p>
               <p>But these Murmurers against Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny never consider, that Men commit a a greater Violation of Wedlock, which is indeed the chief occasion of all those dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Feuds, that disturb the pleasures of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43678:47"/> when they take a far greater Liberty themselves to revel with their Misses and Concubines in Private Country Corners, where they go for Man and Wife, while the poor Woman at home thinks he is gone to gather in his Debts, as he makes her believe. It has been observ'd, when at t'other end of the Town a Strumpet has come into a Mercers Shop and taken up a Gown and Petticoat of the best Silk in his Counter; and when she was gone, the Sly-Thief-to-himself of a Whore-master, has Book'd it down to some Invisible great Lady at Court. And thus it is, that the Pleasures of Matrimony must suffer for the Pleasures of Doxy-Copulation. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then 'tis all Fire and Tow in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the Wife finds it out. This is that which makes <hi>Conjugium</hi> to be <hi>Conjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium.</hi> This is that which Untiles the House, and makes Hell upon Earth. And indeed the Woman has reason of her side, when she finds her Husband so liberal to a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, yet grudging his Wife a Frisk into the Country among her Friends, or a Fortnights scowring at <hi>Epsom</hi> once in three or four Summers, in a long Vacati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they have nothing else to do, but to play at <hi>Draughts</hi> i' the Back Shop,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43678:48"/> or read the <hi>Turkish History</hi> behind the Counter.</p>

Here again, set the Hares-Foot to the Goose-Giblets; let the Man but consider, that where there are no Children, there is the less charge, but the Pleasures of the Bed are still the same.

How many Men are forc'd to

Nay, some Women are so unconscionable, as to bring two at a Time, others three at a Birth. An unreasonable thing that the poor Men should pay so dear for their sport. More than this, there have been some Women that have Teem'd two at a Lying-in, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Month after they have been Marry'd. Should all Women contrive at that Rate, the Men must all have <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s Estates to maintain 'em. But some Women must have a little seasoning of pain to relish their Pleasures; and among the rest, this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man longs for a Child, and a Child she will have, if it be to be had above ground; and the more to whet her Appetite, in her Rambling Visits among her Neighbours and Friends, she sees, at one place a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Plump-Cheek'd Baby of a Boy staring about in his Nurses Arms—Lord, quo she, what a Lusty Child is this?— How long have you been Marry'd Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour?

The words are hardly out of her Mouth, before another Neighbour steps in, and having heard part of the Complaint, What's the Matter with our Neighbour here? quo she. Matter! quo the t'other, Matter enough by my Faith —she has been Marry'd above this half year, and nothing yet coming. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, that's not well, quo the t'other Neighbour—and yet it may be, that the Man's in no fault—S'life, quo the young Woman, the Man in no fault! As if a Woman of my Age and Complexion, could be in the fault—I know my own Complexion, and my own Abilities so well, that I'll give all the World leave to judge whether the fault be mine, or no. Patience a little, quo the second Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I have known some Women that have not been with Child, till after they have been two or three years Marry'd. Yes! And do you think I'll stay so long, quo the young Woman in a pelting Chase, not I by my Fackins—At these words, in steps another Neighbour, one of the more experienc'd sort, and tells 'em she had been at such a one's Groaning— What! quo the t'other, is my Neighbour
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43678:49"/> such a one brought to Bed? Of a Delicate Boy, quo the t'other. And how long has she been Married? cries the young Woman. But t'other day, quo the other— S'life but t'other day! And I have been Married this half year, and have nothing to shew for't!</p>
               <p>This Debate holds a long time—but at length cries one a little Wiser than the rest—Mrs. <hi>Such-a-one,</hi> this is a Matter of great Importance, and therefore pray go home, and take the Exact Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of your Husbands Gunging Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to the Length and Compass: For till that be done, it will not be an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie thing to make a Right Judgment of the Business.</p>
               <p>Come, come, says another, I know my Neighbour <hi>Such-a-one</hi> very well, and I am not apt to have an ill Opinion of him: I am sure he's a Man likely enough: He's only newly Marry'd, and a Man may Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress his Wife as well too much, as too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.

The Woman desir'd the Apothecary to let her have a Dose, and having paid him for it, without disputing the Price, she carry'd it home with a light heart, and administring her Physick according to her Directions found the Operation of it to her Content, without any harm to the Husband.</p>
               <p>But the Apothecary's Wife who had in a private Corner behind the Shop listen'd all this while to the Discourse that passed between her Husband and the good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and thought she stood in as much need of the Receipt as her Companion. Ay, quo she to her self, and y'fackins I'll be my Husbands Physician for once; and observing whence her Husband took out the Powder, within two or three days after her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band desiring her to make him some good Pottage to warm his Stomach, underpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of fetching some Spice to put into the Broth, she took the remainder of pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd <hi>Cantharides,</hi> and put it into the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43678:51"/> Pot without any regard of Weight or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. When 'twas ready, her Husband as greedily supp'd up a Large Mess: Nor was it long before he found the Effects and heat of it, which he thought to qualifie by the assistance of his Wife; but alass the Flame did so increase, that his very Entrail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> seem'd to be in a Conflagration. He swore to his Wife she had Poyson'd him, and ask'd her what she had put i' the Broth. VVho made him answer, she had put no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing into the Broth that was extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but a handful of the Powder which he had sold the other day to the VVoman that came to him about her Husband. Then the poor Apothecary understanding the whole matter and cause of his Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in his Extremity curs'd her to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and sent for another of his own Trade to relieve him; which was not so easily done, but that it had like to have cost him his Life.</p>
               <p>Now, bating the <hi>Cantharides,</hi> do you think it is not a great pleasure to a Man to find himself so kindly nursed and cherished by his Wife, Cock-brothed, Oyster-Fed, and Night and Morning Eryngo's and Tent; and every day fresh Overtures of Conjugal Dalliance, and new Allurements, to kiss, embrace and love one another?
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43678:51"/> These are Comforts of Comforts, and a Man that has such a Wife, such a Nurse, and such a Bed-fellow, so buxom, free and wanton as this, is the happiest of all Marryed Men.</p>
               <p>But after all this, thinks the young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to her self, all this cost is meerly thrown away, if I have not my due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. For what's a Work-man without his Tools? If I send my Maid to the Ale-house for a Quart of Beer, if she does not bring me my Measure, I call the Fellow that drew it Knave, and my Maid Baggage: and I call the Milk-woman cheating Slut, if she does not fill my Pan, when I know how much is my due. This brings to her Remembrance the first Admonition given her to take an exact Accompt of Length and Compass, which she fails not to do, and to carry it along with her to the next Meeting, within two or three days after.</p>
               <p>But then there happens a general Stupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Astonishment among the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Relations, when they find the two pieces of Apron-string snipp'd off, that of the length to hold out full six, and the Circumference between three or four Inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Then they begin to shake their Heads, and hang their Lipps, telling the young Woman, that now begins to be as dejected
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43678:52"/> as themselves.—'Slife, Neighbour, here's nothing but all perfect Justice—your Husband is a Man every Inch of him— We must search for the fault somewhere else—Nay it would be given against you in the Court of Arches—I knew a Taylor, cries one of the Neighbours, that was laughed at as long as he lived, for his Wife mistaking her Husbands— for her own Thumb, slipped on her Wedding-Ring once, and pulled it off again; but when she thought to have done so a second time, it swelled, and put her Husband to that excessive pain, that she was forced to send for a Chirurgeon to have it filed off —But you Mistress make no such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and therefore we must not easily give Sentence against due Proportion. I don't know how it is, not I, cries the young Woman, ready to burst into Tears for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, but so it is. I know a young mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed Couple, quo another, that were just in your Case, and the Physician told me himself, he gave the Husband this Advice, which was, to absent himself out of Town for Fifteen days, and the Sixteenth day to get a Horse-back, and so to order it, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an easie Journey of Ten of Twelve Miles, to come home Just in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:43678:52"/>
               <p>At the same time, he also gave Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that his Wife should provide him for Supper a Legg of Mutton boiled with a Sallad of <hi>Garden-Rocket,</hi> a Capon roasted, and a Glass of good Red-Wine. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that he should place himself at Supper, right against his Wife, bare necked, and naked breasted.</p>
               <p>Three hours after Supper, he bid the Gentleman go to Bed, lie close to his Wife, and Sleep out his first Sleep; after that, to enter into Amorous Discourse with his Wife, as awake as himself; and when he had so heightned his Discourse, to fall to his Work. And this Counsel was so For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, that it not only had its effect upon this Gentleman, but upon several others in the same Condition. What greater Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure can a man have, then to have the free leave of his Wife to take his Lopes for fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days together, and then to come a hand-gallop home agen, to give her all the Content and Satisfaction she can Desire, to the great Joy of both Parties, and the next Morning, to take a lusty Beverage of Yolks of Eggs, Sugar, Saffron, Cinamon and strong Wine? By which you may find that the <hi>French</hi>-Men and Women in <hi>Provence,</hi> know what's good for themselves. This Course of Life will cause a Man's
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43678:53"/> Wife to Embrace him like an Angel, and to shew him a Thousand other Friendly Entertainments beyond Imagination. 'Twill be always in the Evening, <hi>My Dear, come to Bed,</hi> and in the Morning, <hi>Love, lie a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle longer.</hi> If these are not Pleasures, I know not what Pleasures they are that these Dispisers of Matrimony would have.</p>
               <p>But if Justice get the Upper-hand, and that it comes to pass that the Man is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, can there be a greater Satisfaction to a Man than to find that he has a whole Jury of Women of his side, and that he passes for <hi>rectus in Curia</hi> from one end of the Parish to the other? But what proof of this? Proof sufficient. The Wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n have examined the Case; and they find her of a Temper, either too cold or too hot; too profuse or too scanty— Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture must be tamed or excited— to which purpose the young Woman must take Physick; and that taking of Physick is like the School Argument, <hi>Either so, or so, but not so, Therefore.</hi> And I think 'tis a very great Pleasure of Matrimony for a man to have such a Plea for himself: A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times better for a man to put it to the Test and Tryal of a due Course of Physick, than to the Examination of the Court of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43678:53"/> Arches; where a man must be exposed to the Tryal of forcing Nature before a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Persons of his own Sex; enough to daunt the Impudency, and quell the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of <hi>Hercules</hi> himself. The Chees<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger and his Wife — took a far wiser Course. For they by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry having scraped a pretty Estate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but not able to get a Child between them to Inherit their Labours, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been many years marryed; at length, they grew very melancholy to think they should die Issueless. At last, the Woman (for had it not began there, the Plot had been spoiled) began to consider where the fault lay, but not being able to determine it her self, quo she, to her Husband, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> — Well Honey, quo he,— We are blest with an Estate, quo she, but we have neither Heir, nor Heiress to leave it to— That's no fault of mine, quo the Husband—Nay, Husband, quo she, that's the point to be try'd—Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! quo the Husband—how shall we try it more than we have done? Why look thee, Husband, I have a conceit in my Head, quo she, — Ay Wife, quo he, but a thousand conceits i' thy Head will never make one Child — Nay, Husband, pray hear me, quo she, —I have a conceit i'
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43678:54"/> my Head, if thou and I can agree— VVhy VVife, quo he, thou knowest I have in all things been guided by thee. VVhy then Husband, quo she, thou knowest, that we have been long marryed in vain; for we cannot get a Child, tho all ways and means have been used between us — 'Tis too true, VVife, quo the Husband — VVhy then, quo the VVife, for the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of both, if thou wilt agree, I am content with all my heart, do thou choose out a Companion, for thy Humour, and I'll find out another to mine: and whether I am got with Child, or thou gettest the Child we'll resolve both to keep it as our own. The Husband was over-joyed at his VVifes Contrivance, and took his Maid, a good brisk VVench; the VVife was pleased at her Husbands Condescention, and made choice of her Journey-man— And now 'twas presently discovered where the fault lay. The Journey-man laboured in vain; but the Maid was unmaidened and brought to bed of a brave Boy. Bobs, there was joy in the Family, but the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were disgruntled, and the Church-VVardens would have the Master and the Maid <hi>Coram nobis,</hi> No, quo the VVife, there's no Occasion for this, quo she to the Magistrate, all Parties acted by consent,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43678:54"/> and my Husband and I take the Child for our own, and are resolved to keep it as our own, and what has any body to say to't? It may be thought that many such Tryals as these would prevent a world of Drs-Commons Law, and preserve thousands of Families in peace and tranquility free from Heart-burnings, and continual mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and grumblings, between the good Man and the VVoman. Here the Husband had the pleasure of his maid, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress of her man; the Child was the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters own, and the maid bestowed it upon her Mistress, the Mistress owned the Gift, and the Maid was ready tryed for another. So far from being the discomfort of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, that it was the only Comfort the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and VVife had had, during the whole time of their VVedlock.</p>
               <p>However 'tis concluded, that the Young VVoman shall try the experiment of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick; the Female Cabal will have it so, and so it must be. Immediately all the Quack-Bills are examined, and a <hi>French</hi> Doctor is sent for. And no sooner is he sent to, but he comes flying, with his <hi>Scrapes</hi> and his <hi>Cringes,</hi> his <hi>Madames</hi> and <hi>Begars,</hi> his <hi>me doe dis,</hi> and <hi>me do dat; me cause your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban make a de shield upon your Bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43678:55"/> but be a great Recreation to the Husband, especially if he be melancholy: But the chiefest pleasure is that the Man must still try the Operation of the Physick, which tho it tye him a little too hard to duty, yet it must needs augment the Pleasure of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony extreamly. If her dyet be tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and dainty, as if the <hi>French</hi> Doctor be no Fool, he seldom prescribes other, the Husband has his share, and that is still ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleasure. Nay it may so happen that the <hi>French</hi> Doctor may kill her with his Potions and Lotions, and then he has the Accomplishment of all the Pleasures of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, which is to bury her and marry another.</p>
               <p>If the choice of a Grave dissembling Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite of a Midwife, better please the young VVoman, the Husband shall then have Pleasures of another sort: For then the old Matron will tipple and talk bawdy with him till her Chin drop in her bosom. The Comfort is, her Physick is all heartning; she quenches no flames, especially those of Love; she abominates the use of Rue, Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, and the four Cold Seeds: All this while the young man takes Care that his young VVife want nothing to welcom her Chamber-Visitants, and he tells her him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to boot, that it is his chiefest delight he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43678:55"/> has in the world to please her. Lastly if all this cost does not agree with the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Husbands Cash, 'tis but retiring into <hi>White-Fryers,</hi> and laughing at his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, and there's another Comfort of Matrimony.</p>

'Tis true, the woman sav'd her Husband a whole years expence: And what said one of the Gossips to him, when she was brought to Bed? Courage Neighbour, you may be sure this is ripe.

And then it is, that the time is come for
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43678:57"/> a VVoman to try the Affection of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who would be thought the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind person in the world, to venture the Life of his Dearest Consort, and the loss of the Fruits of all his Nocturnal Labour for the want of two or three plump Partrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or the Corner of a Venison-Pasty E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when he can but ask and have.

And therefore, 'tis Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to blame a VVoman for gadding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and prowling among her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours at such a Time as this: And 'tis the cheapest way for the Husband too to carry her up and down from place to place, where ere he can smell a good bit. It would be an unseasonable mercy shown to his Pamper'd Gelding; nay, tho it were to the Soles of his Feet, to grutch the Trudging, tho it were ten Miles

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43678:60"/> may meet with for his Loving Sedulity? A Souldier once upon a time, I mean one of those that used to hire themselves out upon the Train'd-Bands, asked leave of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then upon the Guard, to let him go home in a cold Frosty-Night, and lie with his Wife. The Captain was Civil. Away goes the Souldier, unlocks the Door of his mean Habitation, and up he mounts in the dark to his Wives Chamber; and it was come so near to the point, that the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had flung his Breeches upon the Bed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ready to step in. But his Wife was taken with such a suddain Qualm, that unless he fetched her a Cordial immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, she was a dead Woman; and so well she counterfeited her pangs, that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier believing his Wife to be at deaths Door, snatched up his Breeches again, as he thought, put 'em on, away he flew to the next Apothecary. What would he have? Why a Cordial — What Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial? Any Cordial, so far as Ten-pence would go, to save his Wive's Life, for he had but a Shilling, and he was willing to reserve Two-pence for his Morning's draught. Thereupon, the Apothecary gave him a small Cordial. But when he went to pay for it, instead of a Shilling, he found a whole Nest of Half-Crowns ready fledged,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43678:61"/> in another Pocket he met with a brood of Guinneys newly hatched; and feeling a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle farther, he found a Gold Watch, and then the Souldier knew what a Clock 'twas. In the mean time his Wives Companion had made his Escape with the single shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling'd Trouses, and the Souldier returned with the Cordial; but then to his great Consolation he found his Wife recovered, and so kind, that she bid him make use of the Cordial himself, for she had no need of it. And thus you see how Fortune Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours Husbands that are so kind to their Wives as to fetch 'em at Midnight what they long for. And therefore let no Man grutch, when his Wife is in a longing fit let it be never so late and dark, to go and fetch his Wife a Cordial, or any of her sweet Jim-crack she calls for.</p>
               <p>Nor let any man Object, that many times 'tis no real Longing of the Woman, but her Liquorish Appetite that makes her so fine-mouthed, and so craving after this and t'other Dainty. But who shall be judge of that? The Woman is with Child, the Woman is Sick; and what she suffers there's no body can tell but her self. However the Endurance of pain and torment that is like to bring the Advantage of Issue, ought to be recompensed to the full. And therefore

               <p>But these upholders of Paradoxes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider not, that in the same Chamber, where the Wife Lies in, the Effect of the Husbands Manhood comes to light. And would you have the Parents want a great Candle or two, to see what God has sent 'em? Man is Born naked; all other Creatures come into the World with their Cloths on; and these Cloths grow as they grow, without the help of Taylors
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43678:62"/> and Coat-sellers. Do you think it is not greatly for the Reputation of the Man, that his Wife has been with Child, and that she is Deliver'd at length of a Lusty Boy? Suppose it be a Girl, that Girl may bring Boys in time; for so the World goes round. The name of <hi>Da Da</hi> is now as pretty a pleasing name as Mr. <hi>Bridegroom</hi> was before. Why, we have heard of many Fathers of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that have been Fathers of Nations, and the first Wife has had always equal respect with the first Husband. Believe me, in some cases the word <hi>Mother,</hi> goes a great deal farther than the word <hi>Father,</hi> in point of Veneration. For without a <hi>Mother</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> might have shaken his heels to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpose. The Man has nothing to do but to get the Child, and then his work's done. 'Tis true if the Man were to breed and bear the Child, as <hi>Daniel Bauhis</hi> the <hi>French</hi>-man did, then the Provision were to be made for him; but in regard it is the General Custom, which never can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, the Provision must be made for them that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e most willing to part with. Now as the Women win the greatest Honour, so ought they to have the more Worship; which Worship consists in the Provision made for her Lying-in, as making a Distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and Ordinary Women. 'Tis true there are some Men, that when from a poor and low Degree, they come to be advanced to vast preferment, love to boast the meanness of the Place where they were Born. As <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth when he came to be Pope, was wont to brag how he came of an Illustrious House, because his Parents were so Poor, that the Walls of the Chamber where his Mother Lay-in, where so battered and torn, that the Sun came in on every side at a thousand holes. But you may be sure the Woman would have had a better Accommodation if she could.</p>
               <p>Women have always an Ambition to equal one another; and when a Woman begins to find her self with Child, she shall have Tutresses enow to tell her what she wants. Women also have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination to Neatness and Gaiety, which Custom has so encreased, that now you shall hardly meet a Woman in the Street, without a Lac'd Petticoat: And
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43678:63"/> Men must accommodate themselves to the Humour and Fashion of the Times. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides theres the Grand mother, a wise and understanding Woman, and she best knows what's fitting for her Daughter. All things put together, there is such a Connexion of Occasions and Reasons, back'd with such Female Arguments on all sides, that there is all the Reason that the Woman should desire what she would have, and have what she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.</p>
               <p>Moreover it may so happen that the Woman may wear the Breeches; and it is not to be imagined but that if she wears the Breeches, she wears the Pockets too; and then if she says she will have it, who shall hinder her? However Fair and Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is better than Ran-dan; Son, (quo the Grand-mother, that is to be) you see that your Wife, my Daughter, is with Child, you also know what a Portion you had with her; you know she has a great many Good Relations and Friends that will come to Visit her, and I should be sorry that any Daughter of mine should Lie-in like a Porters Wife—Mother, cries the young man—Hold Son, quo the Grand-mother—not that I suspect any such thing of my Daughter— But
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43678:64"/> Son, you are lookt upon to have had a good Estate with my Daughter, and I am sure you had a better than <hi>Mr.</hi>— had with his Wife. She Lay-in t'other day, and I'll assure ye, Son, she had all things very decent about her: It will procure you much respect, if you order it so, that my Daughter may be nothing behind her, but rather above her, for there will be notable notice taken. As therefore you have acted like a Husband, you are now to act like a Father. Who now could resist such convincing Arguments as these? For when a Matron of a Wives Mother speaks to the Husband of the Daughter, 'tis as if the Sybil were talking to <hi>Aeneas</hi> about his Journey to Hell, or the Wise Woman of <hi>Delphos</hi> were giving Council to <hi>Solon</hi> about the Laws of <hi>Athens;</hi> all Gravity, and all Unanswerable.</p>
               <p>To this the Son makes Answer, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you know I understand nothing of these things, and therefore I leave all to your management — But, Mother, pray be as sparing as you can—Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! answers the Mother, why did you ever know me to be otherwise? I don't speak Mother for that, replyes the Son— but—But! Why Son, I thought you had had a better opinion of me—I'll assure
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43678:64"/> ye, Son, I have sav'd you above Forty pounds, by giving her two such Suits of Child-Bed Linen already, that the best Aldermans Wife i'the Parish need not be asham'd of—But, Kether—I think I have done a Mothers part—I don't question it, Mother—replies the young Man— Pray Mother, do what you think fit.</p>
               <p>Thus you see you may as well Butt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the City Wall, as Butt against a Wives Mother; for the Mother always sides with the Daughter. However, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, the Shooe comes on without a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-skin; all's easie and gentle. Here's no Plague of Matrimony yet to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd. Well—proceed—</p>
               <p>Suppose the young Man and his Bigg-Belly'd Wife now a Bed together— Laud, my Dear (quo she) had I known Marriage had been so chargeable, I believe thou couldst never have won me— What charges? my Dear, cries the young Man—Laud —my Mother tells me of so many things I shall want, that she makes me e'en Mad—What things; cries her Husband. —My Mother—Laud— my Mother makes me almost wild, she tells me I have a new Bed — Oh now I think on't, cries the Husband, I know where there is a fine Damask Bed to be

Where's the disturbance of Marriage in all this? Here's nothing but Language from the Wife as calm and smooth as Cream in a Milk-bowl, and the Man Condescending in all things.</p>

Then there must be (for these are things that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided) a Crimson Sattin Mantle with a Gold and Silver Lace, as broad — heark ye Son —as broad as your—you know what.

'Tis true I heard of a Vintner that bestowed Forty Pounds upon the <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> of his Child, as the Quaker calls it, and then Broke: and his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were return'd back to the Wife's Friends, like so many <hi>Bromingham</hi> Groats: But Son, that's no President for you, do you take my Advice, and my Blessing, and we shall never want these little Toys that I speak of.</p>
               <p>By my Troth a most moderate Bill— and all this while Money's worth for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney laid out. Why certainly no Man, that was not a meer Miser, ever took it ill, to see his House well furnished. Nor did any Man ever think it an Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Marriage, to retaliate the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Wife's Visitants with Gossips usual and customary diet. He that will
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43678:67"/> have God-fathers and Godmothers to his mind, that will be Liberal to the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife and Nurse, and give the Child a piece of Plate at the Months end, must bribe high; Necklaces of Pearl, Gold Watches, and broad Lac'd Petticoats will not come to Ordinary Gossipings. And therefore they that make these Expences the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts of Matrimony, are a sort of morose Libertines, that desire an End of the World for want of lawful Procr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>tion. For they are such necessary and incumbent expences to the Act of Generation, that you may as well separate the Sea from the Mouth of a River, as part Expence from the Chamber of Delivery. Besides that Man is Lord of the World, and of all the Creatures, and therefore it is fit, that as much of the Creature as may be should attend him at his first entry. Besides this is the only time that a Woman has a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pleasure in her Life. For ten Months Languishing in misery and torture, one Month of a little Transitory delight; a great piece of business indeed. Now she enjoys for a short time, Heaven knows the Fruits of her tedious sufferings; now she has her Friends about her, now she has her fine things and her attendance about her like a little Princess; but no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

Where's the Justice of Men, to deny a poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man one Months Consolation in Twelve? The Man must be mad that takes the Mirth and Jollity of his Neighbours and Friends Caressing his Wife and the Pains of Delivery for the Dis-comforts of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. For were it nothing else, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Child she has brought forth is worth ten times the Value of the Expence. For who knows but that she has made him the Father of a Prince or some Vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orious General, for which Posterity will Honour him? Nay, who knows but that she has brought forth a Martyr? and then she has not only replenish'd the Earth, but added to the number of the Saints. And now let the World judge whether to be the Father of a great Captain, or a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Martyr, be not worth a Silk Fringe, and a Basket or two of Sevil Oranges.</p>
               <p>However let the worst come to the worst, here's a Man-Child born; and it has been the Custom of all Nations to rejoice for the Birth of a Man-Child. Suppose a Man had a Comfit-maker for his Tenant, How should he pay his Rent, but by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Christenings? Then for Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sips to meet, nay to meet at a Christening
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43678:68"/> or a Lying-in, and not talk; you may as well damm up the Arches of <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> as stop their Mouths at such a time. 'Tis a Time when Women, like Parliament-Men, have a Privilege to talk Petty-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against their Husbands. And he's an Ignoramus of a Husband that will not pass an Act of Oblivion for the Trespasses of a Christening Banket.</p>
               <p>Oh! But Midwifes and Nurses! What of them? Why they are to be reckoned among the Intolerable Grievances of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony. Their Reason? Why because the Wife is nice in her choice, and refuses one for being too Young, another too old, a third too Clumsey-fisted, a fourth too Talkative, and a fifth Tipples too much: And can ye blame a Woman for being wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Husband ought to be pleas'd with the discretion of his Wife that labours to bar such Nuisances from approaching his Family, seeking only the necessary Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Gravity and Staidness. And what if she be as coy in the choice of her Nurse, knowing the Generality of those sort of Cattel to be either Sluts or Lazy Jades, Liquorish Carrions, Thieves, or Careless Tiplers of Strong Drink? Certainly it

This were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoil a Man of all good Nature, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade a Man to deny his Wife the assistance of her Neighbours and friends in the most grievous necessities of all their Lives.

               <p>Now suppose the Women do talk a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle merrily over their Cups to the new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they know he has known Woman, and understands something of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Problems.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43678:71"/> won himself such notable Divulgers of his Reputation. I have heard say (says the Midwife) there have been Laws made in some Countries, that if a Woman found her Husband Impotent, she might make choice of the most likely of her next a Kin. But Heavens be prais'd, there is no need of those Laws in this Family— Here Son, here's to the next—and then she drinks off a clever <hi>Supernaculum.</hi> Ha, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (quo the new Father) you do well to encourage a young Gamester—I confess (replies the Midwife) I like a Man that performs his Work within the Year— such a Man's like to be a good Customer to our Trade. Ay, but Mother, (quo the new Father) Where's your kindness to us all this while?—As how Son?— You tell us (reply'd the new Father) of Laws made in kindness to the Women — I wish there were a Law too made for the Men, that the Midwife, or the Nurse, might supply the Wive's place during Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Month— Laud—Sir, cries one of the Company, that would be the way to have none but young Midwifes, and young Nurses, unexperienc'd People, and what should we poor Women do then? Why then Madam, what think you of a Law to be made, that such Women whom
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43678:71"/> their Husbands could not get with Child, should come to us try'd Men, during that Vacation, and see what we could do? There's something in that indeed, quo the Gentlewoman, but I love Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; I don't love that force should be put upon Women in that particular— Charity is one thing, Wantonness another. And therefore the Gentlewoman did well, who having been kind to her Neighbour, while his Wife was in the Straw, refus'd him when he came to request the same Curtesie after his Wife was up and well. — What, quo she, did ye take me for a Whore? And indeed, there may be some reason for a Woman to be kind to her Neighbour at such a time upon two Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations: First, as I said before upon the score of Charity to the Man, and secondly, out of kindness to the Woman, her parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43678:72"/> only for such a time and no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>Now ye talk of having enough to spare, quo the Midwife, I'll tell ye a Story, that I read in my younger days, somewhere or other, I can't tell where. There was a young Gentlewoman that liv'd in some Town or other beyond the Seas, Marry'd a Man, who was not so brisk as my Son here; however he was jealous, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and she had the Misfortune to be taken in the Arms of one that pleas'd her better than her Husband. Whereupon, her Husband, like an Impotent Fool as he was, grew Horn-mad presently, and would needs take the severity of the Law against her, which was no less than Death, if the Fact were prov'd upon her. There wanted no proof, you may be certain, on the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands part; But how d' ye think the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy came off? Quo she to the Judge, Pray ask my Husband, if ever I deny'd him the satisfaction of my Body, when-ever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd it. Which the Husband confess'd to be true. Well then (My Lord) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Lady, What should I have done with the Overplus, that remain'd in my own Power? Should I have Squander'd it away, like the Elder's Maid? Was it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for me to pleasure an honest Gentleman

               <p>How the Devil can a Man spend his time more merrily than in such Company as this? But now comes that, that spoils all again—Within two or three days after, comes the Nurse to the new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and tells him his hopeful Issue has got a Thrush i' the Mouth on't, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to Suck: More than this, that his Wife has got sore Nipples, and in danger of a Fever. Well, and what of all this. Is a Man bound to indemnifie his Wife or his Children, from the Infirmities of Nature? But here's the wonder, that when the Wife or the Infant are fallen under any Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it should be counted a Disturbance of Wedlock to send for a Doctor or a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon to procure their Recovery. And yet the same Persons care not what they Lavish away upon a young Colt, nor what they spend upon a Surfeited Race-Horse. How many Mens Stables cost 'em more than their Wives Bed-Chambers? One
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43678:73"/>
                  <hi>Strawberry,</hi> or a <hi>Tregonnel,</hi> shall be more charily lookt after, than all the Wives and Children in <hi>Europe.</hi> A pleasant Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, to grutch a Sick Wife and Child the Assistance of a Nurse and a Physician, when a Fillie-foal forsooth, must have at least three or four Men-dry. Nurses to tend him at a time. Nay should the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd Beast fall Sick, there are some would Exchange a Child for a Colt at any time and acknowledge it a kindness from Heaven to take the one and spare the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But then they are troubled, that the Neighbours when they hear of the Woman or the Childs illness, should be so diligent and good natur'd as to visit the Sick. The Communication of their Experience, the Probatums and Recipe's is a disturbance of Matrimony. They make a noise i'the Chamber they cry. What if they do? their talk does not cost any thing; or what if it did? 'Tis not a Three-peny matter, compar'd to what your <hi>Jowler</hi> and <hi>Trowler</hi>—Men spend upon a Company of yelping Hounds. Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they say is the touch-stone of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship—Here's the Woman ill and her Friends come to visit her—Here's the Child sick, and the Neighbours bring Cart-loads of

For still many Heads are better than one.</p>
               <p>But now, both the Child and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are well again; and the Mother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to require a stronger and more costly Diet than Oatmeal Caudles, and New-laid-Eggs. She must have Pearch and Pullets, and Pidgeons, and Widgeons, Roast-Veal, and young Turkeys, and I know not what my self. Well—and what now?— The Men will have all these Delicacies by themselves at the Tavern, tho they never Lay-in in their Lives, while their poor Lying-in Wives, after such a Waste of Blood and Spirits must be debarr'd the Common Restoratives of Nature. And thus we find all along, 'tis not Matrimony, but the Expence of Matrimony that these Men grumble at. Could there be but a way found for Men to keep their Wives and Children for nothing, you should see what Encomiums and Panegyricks would
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43678:74"/> be made upon Wedlock. 'Tis a wonder among so many Projects that the <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Oh but they'll say there's a Reason in Roasting of Eggs. A Child-Bed Woman may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored at a cheaper rate after her Molting time, than with dissolv'd Pearl and But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Crabs. But suppose the kind Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band thinks nothing too good for her, must he be stinted by a Ragamuffin of a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-Hater?

Now let the World judge; the Good Woman's reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, has born the Brunt of a hard La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, has replenish'd the World; there's ne'er a Maid the less for her as they say, and her Acquaintance and Friends, such as she sent for, such as came at Midnight, are summon'd to Congratulate her Recovery, what a Reputation now would it be for the Husband, that when they come together, they should find nothing but a piece of dry Bread and <hi>Suffolk</hi> Cheese to comfort their Hearts? These are Crums of cold Comfort for Gentlewomen to come a Mile or two
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43678:75"/> to a Gossiping. Women are Sociable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and have Tongues in their Heads as well as Men. But their Discourse is a Grievance of Matrimony. Heavens bless us! Would you have 'em sit like so many <hi>Turks</hi> in a Coffee-House, Smoaking their Noses, and Drinking Sherbet, without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one to another for a whole day toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? 'Tis not their business to trouble their Heads with Elections of Sheriffs or Parliament Men. Pray give 'em leave to talk of such things as fall within the Verge of their Understandings. 'Tis their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to bring Children into the World; upon which, many Casualties depend, and these Casualties produce a thousand Themes for Discourse. When they talk Bawdy, 'tis not Bawdy in them, but pure Philosophy. How many Gossiping places are there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this City for Men? There is <hi>John</hi>'s Coffee-House, and <hi>Dick</hi>'s Coffee-House, and the <hi>Royal</hi> Coffee-House, the <hi>Exchange</hi> Coffee-House, and the <hi>Widow</hi>'s Coffee-House, and <hi>Sam</hi>'s Coffee-House, besides Two Thousand Four Hundred and Fifty Coffee-Houses more, where you shall hear Men with Green Aprons talking and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together so Idlely, so Coxcomically, so Pragmatically, that 'twould make a Man Spew to her 'em. Here sits one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43678:75"/> of Ideots Reforming the State; there another sits telling ye what the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> intends to do the next Summer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he has quitted the Field this Autumn. While the rest sit streaming their Eyes, and gaping after News as Maids hearken after Sweet-hearts. And by and by comes in one for their Turn, that sits him down, and amuses the Gulls with more Lyes than are in <hi>Mandevil.</hi> Another tells 'em of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he has to make Town-Tops spin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Eel-Skin, as if he bore malice to the School-Boys. And if a <hi>German</hi> Doctor come in to entertain 'em with Rhodoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tados in Physick, you shall hardly perswade 'em to quit the Room.</p>
               <p>But the VVomen's Discourse is patt and home to the business in hand. If they come to a Sitting-up Feast, they laugh and are merry over their Rhenish-VVine and Goose-Pye; if they are Invited to a Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral they weep over their Burnt VVine and <hi>Naples</hi> Biscuit. This is to the Purpose: And indeed at a Gossiping Feast the work of Generation is so large a Theme, and so pleasing, that it holds 'em tack in spite of their Teeth. There are so many Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dixes belong to the work of Generation, so many Accidents, some Precedent, some Subsequent; so many Questions to be put
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43678:76"/> concerning it, that tho a Gossips Feast should endure a whole Century, it would be time little enough to discourse upon the several Subjects.</p>
               <p>For Example, one VVoman is troubl'd in Conscience about what time of the Day or Night is best for a Man to Caress his Wife. Now where would you have this Question put, but in an Assembly of those that have try'd, and are best able to settle the Matter? Thereupon the Question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fairly started, that in the four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Hours, there were two times chiefly to be observ'd for a Man to yield Obedience to the Commands of Love, the one four or five Hours after Dinner, and the other four or five Hours after Supper. For then said he, the Body is neither too full, nor too empty, the Concoction of the Stomach is in some measure perfected, the natural heat is refreshed, and the Spirits are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and that tho the Man should be at a great Expence, yet there would be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve left for the Foundation of a new Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Another cry'd, she had heard that the Evening Caresses were more delightful, and the Morning Embraces more whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som. If so, cries a third, then let me have the Evening Caresses for Pleasure, and the Morning Embraces for Health.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43678:76"/> Upon all which, and much more that was said to the same purpose, another conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that there was no reason for a Man that was sane to be so Superstitious in the Observance of Times and Seasons; but that which troubl'd her most was to know, what were the certain Limits which Nature had set to the frequency of performance. Here, one of the Gossips taking her up, Neighbour, Neighbour, if the Men would but do as they say, that Question would soon be answer'd. For I heard, my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band should make his brags a while ago at the Tavern among his Wine-bibbing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, that he was a second <hi>Hercules,</hi> but he lies like a stinking Knave as he is. Bless me! cries another, what d' ye talk of Limits in this particular? As if a Man were to be stinted in this Case, let him do as often as he pleases, he shall never be stinted for me. I'll never do as the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> Woman did, complain to the King of her Husbands over frequent kindness to her, and force the King by her Tears and her Importunity to such a stint. Why, was there ever such a Woman indeed Lau? cries another. Ay, indeed was there, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys the other, if Stories be true; but this I read particularly in a Book of Midwifery. Bodikins, cries the other, the King should
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43678:77"/> never have stinted my Husband, had he been the best King i' the World. What Authority, I would fain know, has a King to stint my Husband? At which they all fall a Laughing—And after a Cup about, they fall off from their Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, and enter into a Discourse about the Duty of Husbands. Marry, cries one, and I think 'tis but all the Reason in the World, that our Husbands should be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to us, when we bear the burthen of the day—If we bear, 'tis but fit they should suffer—My Husband when I was first Marry'd, was forc'd to Court me a whole Week, to let him come to Bed to me, for only neglecting to fetch me home from such a Gossiping as this, as I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him.—I have made him rise many a time in a Frosty Morning to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle me a Fire in my Chamber, when my Maid has been sick—But what if he would not—Why then, cries the other, I'd have kickt him out of the Bed; that's the long and the short on't. You are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, Madam, cries the other—I wish I could say so too—My Husband comes in roaring and ranting a Nights, and if I give him the least angry word, 'tis true, he does not beat me, but he falls a banging the Great Looking-Glass i' my Dining-Room,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43678:77"/> and then I fall a crying, and am forc'd to hold my peace, for fear of my <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Cabinet—You are a Fool, Neighbour—the next time he serves you so, I'll tell ye what you shall do —go to the next Shop where you are known, and take up upon his Score, as many Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glasses as will hang round the Room— Cuds-fish—cries the Complainant— he'll send 'em home again, and what shall I be the better for that?—No—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he shall do that, break 'em your self, cries the other, 'twill make him weary of breaking Looking-Glasses, I warrant ye. My Neighbours i'the right for that, cries another; but what if my Husband think it his Duty to get his Maid with Child? Oh Neighbour (replies the other) there's the Law of Titt for Tatt, in that Case— let your man get you with Child—I was going t'other day to look for an odd Petticoat in a High Press that I have i'the Garret; and what should I find there, but the sweetest Babe that ever I saw i'my Life, fast asleep, and as mute as a Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—Presently I call'd up my Maid, and askt her whose Child that was? She fell on her Knees, and told me it was her's: By whom I pray now, Mrs. <hi>Gillian,</hi> (q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o I?) By my Master forsooth, (quo she) and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:43678:78"/> I could not find i'my Heart to Murder it, but have tended it so carefully ever since it was Born, that I am sure you never heard it cry or make the least noise in this World. Truly I was so taken with the Ingenuity of my Maid, that I presently sent for a Nurse, and put it out at my own Charges. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they all cry, there was no revenge in that—No, (quo she) but there is in this, that the next of mine, will be none of my Husbands, I can tell him that for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Besides I read him such a Curtain Lecture for it, that the poor Cuckold was forc'd to down of his Marrow-bones and ask me forgiveness to Boot.</p>
               <p>Truly Neighbour (cries one) in my Opinion your first Revenge was a little too severe; had you only given him a Curtain Lecture, and made him pay for keeping the Child, it had been enough. For it is grown so customary now adays, for Masters to Kiss their Maids; that they will Kiss their Maids tho' the Mistress lay a dying. I have heard of a Sadler, that had a very careful good Wife; but because she was not Immortal, she fell so ill of a suddain, that her Husband verily thought she had been upon her Death Bed. While she lay in this Condition, he sobb'd, he wept, he bemoaned his loss, and nothing
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43678:78"/> would serve him, but he would die with her. At last when he thought her past recovery, and perceived no Body in the Chamber but his dying Wife, and a Chamber maid beautiful enough, he bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>k'nd her to him, and in a soft and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Tone; <hi>Betty</hi> (said he) I am now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to die my self, since thy Mistress is so near her end; and therefore I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my House and Children to thy care, and so saying, deliver'd her the Keys of all he had.</p>
               <p>The poor Girl touch'd with compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, besought her Master, gave him the most comfortable Language she could; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching him to lay aside such despairing thoughts. O <hi>Betty, Betty,</hi> (cry'd the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster) there is but one thing can recover me, and that is thy kindness to me; and so saying, he threw her upon the Bed, and began to feel her Breasts. Which his Wife that had not spoken in three days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beholding, it put her into such a rage, that she recover'd and liv'd many years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to upbraid the Falseness of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd.</p>
               <p>Now ye talk of Maids (cries another) I'll tell ye a Story of a Maid, that served me about three or four years after I was Marry'd. She was a good handsome Girl,
<pb facs="tcp:43678:79"/> and my Husband had such an aching Tooth at her, that he follow'd her up and down the House, when I was out of the way, and would never let her be at quiet: of all which the Maid was so honest as still to give me an Account. At length the Wench wearied with his Courtship, resolv'd to put a trick upon him, that so she might be rid of him; which fell out Luckily. For it happen'd that one day, my Husband thinking I had been safe, found her sifting Flour in the Pastry to make Apple-pies, with a Straw-Hat on her Head, and a Night-rail about her Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and there laid close Siege to her. The Maid presently lays hold of this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and having seemingly conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended, desires him to put on her Hat and her Night-rail, and to keep the Bolter go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while she went out upon the scout to see that all things were secure. To all which my Husband readily consented. But y'faith, my Maid serv'd him a Trick for his Learning; for away came she run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to me, and told me in what a posture she had left him: nor was I less hasty to see what a new Pastry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid I had got—But Laud— when I saw my Husband so strangely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizen'd in his Straw Hat and his Night-Rail—I
<pb facs="tcp:43678:79"/> thought I should have dy'd with Laughing—Honest Maid, (quo I) what wages shall I give you a Month? you l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ok like one that would prove an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Servant. My Husband hearing my voice, and finding himself betray'd, you would have burst your sides to see how he lookt, with his Face all Meally, and star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a roasted Pigg—down went the Straw-Hat, off went the Night-Rail, and away he ran out at the Back-door as if the Devil had been at his Tail—I think so he was (quo another) when you were so near him, This puts 'em all into such a loud Laughter, that 'twas a wonder they did not break the Backs of the Chairs with their Shoulders; and some were so taken with the Story that they could not forbear Laughing backward as well as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Come Neighbours, (cries another) this is a time to be merry and tell Stories— but first let's drink— here Gossip, here's to your next Husband and mine— Faith, (quo she) I drink as I think— So—now to my Story— I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my mother was wont to tell a Tale of a Neighbour of hers, a good wealthy Farmer, who had a very good woman to his VVife, that brought him a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43678:80"/> good Fortune, and made it her Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to please him in all things, and he was no less afraid to displease her; but for all the great Love he bore her, he was withal so charitable, that many times he gave to his Neighbours what was more properly due to his Wife. This Farmer had a Dairy-maid of a delicate Complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, for whom he had a very great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but fearing his Wife should take notice of it, he made great complaints of her every day to his Wife, telling her what a lazy Slut she was, and wondring why she did not bang her sides. Why then, (quo the good Woman to her Husband, suspecting nothing) do you bang her sides; you see her miscarriages oftner than I— why then Wife (quo the Husband) with your leave, so I will — but now I think on't (quo he) should I make use of my Cudgel, my hand is so heavy I should break her Bones—but twigs break no Ribs—I'll 'en exercise my Talent upon her Buttocks, as you do by your Children, and I warrant I'll bring her to something —as you think fit for that, (quo the Wife) for I have neither the Heart to beat her to purpose, nor the Streng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster her. Away goes the Husband, and like a cruel Beadle, provides himself of a swing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43678:80"/> Rod no less dreadful than the Picture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n <hi>Winchester</hi> School; so that the poor Woman had more pity of her Maid, than suspicion of her Husband.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Spirit moving him, up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e gets from his Wife betimes in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and away he posts to his Dairy-Maid in the Garret, where he gave her another sort of Chastizement, than what his Wife meant. When he had done, the Wench fell a crying, the Master fell a Thrashing the Coverlet and Bed-posts, till he had worn the Rod to the very stumps, and so returning to his Wife—Well (quo he) I think I have done her business—I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve she'll remember <hi>May-day</hi> morning as long as she lives. Within a few days after, the Maid being taken with a Qualm of Repentance, comes to her Mistress and falling upon her knees, with Tears in her Eyes began to tell her, how that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band had done her the greatest wrong i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable. Her Mistress thinking it had been the business of the Rods, not suffering her to go on—Your Master, (quo she) has done well—'twas no more than I bid him do—all that I fear is, he has not done so much as he should have done. The Dairy-maid hearing her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses Approbation, began to have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43678:81"/> Opinion of her self, and to believe it no Sin for a Maid to lie with her Master, especially when the Bed-posts suffer'd for it: and from that time forward resolved never to refuse her Master's Correction when ever he was so kind as to give it her.</p>
               <p>Lau ye now, cries another, are not these Men a wicked sort of People to accuse Women of so much Subtilty, as they do —Here was a Knave in Grain ought to have been hung up by the Heels, for all the Good Women in the Parish to have had a lash at his Tail, for deceiving a Good Woman as he did—But i'saith, he should not have cozen'd me so; if he would have been Correcting, I'd have seen the Correction done my self.

               <p>By this time their Husbands were come to attend 'em home, and the young Father unwilling to disturb their Mirth before, enters with all his Myrmidons.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43678:83"/> by what strange Accidents they came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—Laud—cries one, I no more dreamt of having this Husband of mine two days before I had him, than I dreamt to be Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>—For I was Courted by as Compleat a Handsom young Man as you should see in a Summers day —but he (forsooth) when all things were agreed upon, besides my Portion, would needs have a Mare that my Father had in his Stable, or else 'twas no Bargain: Nay, thought I, if you come a Wooing to my Father's Mare, and not to me, e'en fare ye well—I'll be no Man's Wife that must have a Mare for his <hi>Miss;</hi> and so I hit upon this Cock Robin here — Ah <hi>Bobb,</hi> wouldst thou but take my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, thou might'st be a happy Man— Hickup, Hickcup, quo another, I have a Ne'er-be-good too yonder, Hickup, Do what I can for my Life, Hickup—I can't keep him out of the Bowling-Green, Hickup—in <hi>Whitmore-Fields,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I walk that way, Hickup—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But it is not so with the Children of this Age, they must be Coated for the convenience of the Nurses turning up their shitten Tails.

Now is not this worth a good Dinner d'ye think?—Certainly there cannot be a greater pleasure to a man, than to find that his Child has such Benefactors before he is five weeks old—as if the free Gifts of Guilt Spoons and Silver Tankards were to be reck'n'd among the Dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he did at first, and then there's every Child a new Tankard. For look ye, there's Policy in all things—The next Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sips Feast, the Husband brings forth his Guilt Spoons and his Tankard—and cries, these Spoons were given my Son <hi>Tom</hi> by his God-father, and this Tankard was given him by his God-mother — which is enough to teach the others what Copy to follow. Whence we must infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conclude, that Coating a Child is no Discomfort of Matrimony: rather a man would choose that his Wife would bring forth every month for such Silver Comforts as these.</p>
               <p>But here's the business; the mother does not care for the Trouble of Suckling her Child her self, and therefore there must be a VVet-Nurse taken into the House, and the Devil's in that sort of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. For then you shall have a Stuff-gut, a Stroy-good, a Spoil-all, a Tale-bearer, and what not. She must have the first cut of the meat from the Table; she must have her Toast and Sack a mornings, and her Quarts of all Ale at Dinner and Supper; and between meals, there's nothing can rest i'the Cup-board for the VVorm in her greedy Gut. VVhat of all this? as if a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43678:87"/> Mother could be too indulgent to her Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Sister, that supplies her stead. Good Liquor and often feeding breeds good Milk, and good Milk makes fat growing Children. D'ye think a Mother does not take more delight in calling her Child <hi>Fat Fubbs,</hi> than <hi>Skeleton?</hi> and do ye think it is not as great a pleasure for a Father to see his Child thrive, rather than prove a starveling? More than this, I must tell ye that in <hi>Ireland</hi> your Foster Sisters do not only suckle the Child but the Father too; and can there be a greater pleasure and advantage of Matrimony, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from thence, by the Virtue of getting Children, the opportunity of enjoying a kind of Legal variety? For he's a Fool of a Foster-Brother that will not change his Foster-Sisters every Child, supposing his Affection to the Old one be worn out. Now is there any man so unconscionable as to believe that such a VVoman does not deserve good Victuals and good Drink that gives the Child and the Father suck both at one time? A' my word 'tis a great exhausting to Nature, and requires a large supply. And therefore let not these mumblers against Matrimony keep such a pudder about the Extravagances of the VVet-Nurse—for what she consumes
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43678:87"/> one way, she saves another; for she keeps the good man from scaperloytring abroad, and spending his money among durty drabbs. She's at hand upon all occasions; and the Devil's in't, if a VVife and Nurse be not enough for one man. I confess you may meet with some of your wapping Nurses that are very Pockey; but they are so Conscionable, that they will never let themselves be felt for fear of discovery; by which means the Father escapes, tho' they send the Child to <hi>Peg-Trantum</hi>'s in a small time; which may be a great ease to a man sometimes, especially if his Wife come too fast.</p>
               <p>But suppose the Child be put out to Nurse i'the Country; then there must be Sope, and Candles, and Sugar, and four Shillings a Week, and the Devil and all. However by this means the Child is out of hearing; some men cannot endure the bawling and yawling of Children, nor the wicked voices of Nurses Singing <hi>Hopkins</hi>'s Tunes to still 'em: they had rather hear a noise of the City Musick behalf over a Fish Dinner. But then there must be another expence, if the Mother be an indulgent Tender-hearted Mother; there must be a journey by Water once a Week at least, to <hi>Brainford,</hi> or <hi>Twitnam;</hi> or else i'the Stage-Coach
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43678:88"/> to <hi>Barnet</hi> or <hi>Croyden:</hi> Well, and how does this affect Matrimony?— Children when they are Born, must be nurs'd—And let me tell ye, a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-man's Wife well drest, may be a good Dish for variety—Here's Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough; an Assignation at Nurses, can never be suspected; and when the pretence is so just, how can the Fact be unlawful? Husband (cries the Wife) how serves the Tide to morrow? for I intend to go and see how the Child does. Thus is she sure for so many Hours, and he scouts another way—At another time, Wife (quo the Husband, I have little to do to morrow, I'll e'en take a walk and see how the Boy does: and then she lays hold of her Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. And thus they both alternately participate of the pleasures of the fresh Air, and a fresh bit for their Cats; and all this by reason the Child is put out to Nurse.</p>
               <p>I have heard a Story of an Elder of his Congregation, one that had clamber'd to the top Pinnacle of Parish preferment, a Common-Council man's Fellow; one that never Cheated, but in the Integrity of his Heart; one with a Saint like look, Peek-bearded, Sattin-cap'd, Diminutive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded; and when he drove a Bargain, one that look'd up to Heaven with his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43678:88"/> Hands upon his Breast in such a manner, that you might have seen his very Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in his Eyes. Yet this Good, Pious, Grave Citizen, upon an accidental step of his Wife into the Country, to see her young Bantling at Nurse, suffer'd his Maid to steal into his Wife's place, and by a surprize of the Devil, got her with Child. 'Tis true, the good Man (for generally such Saints as these have luck) had an Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and dutiful Slip-string to his 'Prentice, that help'd him out at a dead lift; or else who knows what a Family havock it might have produced. I leave you to judge the Afflictions, Torrors and Agonies that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented this Senior of the Vestry, when he found the State of his Condition; in the midst of which he had no Friend to trust to, but his Honest, Vertuous, Young 'Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, but t'other day a Scaperloytring Hedge-bird, that never minded any Business; but now so reformed of a sudden, that it seem'd to be a Miracle. To him therefore he unfolds his Misery, because he knew the young man made no great profession of Godliness, as being one that used to lie out of his House a Nights, and play'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Pranks, with which Satan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires Youth, who readily like, an Arch Crack-rope as he was, apprehends his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43678:89"/> meaning, and most dutifully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to father the Child, to provide a Nurse and hide it up in the Country. And now the <hi>Cur-madgeon</hi> his Master's Stable and Horses are at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. On the other side the young man, without the Constraint of an Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture provides for the Lying-in, appears at the Christning, Junkets his Comrades, and brings in his Bills, which are not to be question'd. Now he might go out, lie out, ramble where he pleas'd; for he is still looking after the Child i'the Country, for the Nurse is order'd to ply him with Notes of what the Child lacks, which he still shew'd his Master in private, to put him in mind of his Mortality. And thus for two years together, that the Child liv'd, and another year after 'twas dead, did Father <hi>Junior</hi> live a most pleasant Life by his good management, to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Solace of his Master, to observe the discretion and fidelity of his young 'Prentice, who by this means had his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster at his Beck, and a Nurse i'the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try at his Command.</p>
               <p>Thus you see it demonstrated, that a a Nurse in the Country may prove a great Refreshment to the Husband, and as great a Convenience to the Wife.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:43678:89"/>

But these are but idle Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions against Matrimony—Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Woman thinks her own Off-spring the Fairest; and all people, especially the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Sex, love to have their Children Buss'd and Dandl'd by Strangers. Who d' ye think was here to day? Cries one Woman to her Husband—I don't know, cries the Man. Why Mrs. <hi>Such a one,</hi> and she brought her Child along with her, a Lovely, Sweet Babe, indeed— and as fine as any Lord's Child— Other Men are kind to their Wives, and let them have what they will for their Children—Ours go like Chimney-Sweepers Bratts—But I'll turn over a new Leaf y'faith—I'll have our Children go as other Folks Children do, and not like the Scum of the Parish— Here's a great Pleasure of Matrimony, for a Man to see his Wife lay hold of good
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43678:90"/> Example. Some Women will never learn, they are either so Sottish or so Niggardly. Nay, there are some Women of that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that they care not what becomes of their Children, let 'em go naked, if they will, for them, so they can get Money enough from their Husbands to trim and trick up themselves, to spend in Coach-Hire. Plays, and Junketting abroad, but take no more notice of their Children, than Catts of their Kittens, after they have Wean'd 'em: Hang such Wives, or send 'em to <hi>Pensilvania.</hi> A Score of them are not worth a Brass Shilling. But she that loves to see her Children as fine as her self, there's your woman that stands upon her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; there's your true loving Mother. 'Tis a sign she loves to get Children. And what greater happiness to a Marry'd Man than to have such a Bed-fellow. Let the Man but find Gay Cloths, and she'll find Children, I warrant ye. What does it signifie for a Man to have delicate red Cheek'd Pippins, and no Body come to commend 'em? That Woman is worth Gold, that loves to see her Children go fine; for then she'll be sure to see 'em kept sweet and clean, for fear of staining their Gaudy Habiliments. All other Creatures come into the World with their Cloths upon
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43678:90"/> their Backs; only Man is born naked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause so many Creatures are Created to Cloath him. And if Women and Children should not go fine, I wonder who should; for they are the chiefly beloved Objects of Man's Eye; and therefore the more Glorious, the more Attractive. As it is in Gardens, where the Embroidery of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Colours charms the sight; so is it no less a pleasure within doors, without doors, every where, to see Women and Children in their Flowr'd Sattins, and Silks of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Hews: They are the Lillies and Roses of the World, when they are fine and gay; but the Weeds and Rubbish of Society, when ragged and sluttish. What a fine Sight my Lord Mayor's Show would be, to see a Company of Nasty, Tatter'd Dunghill-Rakers sitting in the Pageants; but the sight of a Company of Children Spruc'd up, and Glittering in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and Gaudy Tinsels, see how it fills all the Windows in the Streets; and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders croud far and near to gratifie their Eyes with the sight of those finify'd Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions. Batchellors are the greatest Slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens in the World, their Chambers lie like Hogsties; their Kitchins like Deserts, their Diet nothing but Cooks Meat, and a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:43678:91"/> Napkin to eat it upon, in a Room that stinks of Grease and Tabaco, and a Nasty Whore to attend him. But happy is the Man, that has Marry'd a Woman, that loves to see her Children go neat and trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; she'll be sure to see her House kept clean, to have her Meat well drest, and her Bed smell of Rose-Cakes, and Lavender, and then a Man lives like a Lord.</p>
               <p>As for Sickness, and Meazles, and Small-Pox's, we have nothing to say to that; they are Accidents not to be avoided: Tho give me leave to tell ye, there is nothing more generally preserves Children from those Distempers, than their going fine, and being kept sweet and clean from stench and Nastiness.

Fine Cloths, an Exquisite Voice, and a Swimming Marriage in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, have many times bewitch'd many a young Gentleman—and many times a Man had better give a Thousand Pound for a well Educated, good Condition'd young Gentlewoman, than take a Wife with double the Portion— What says the young Man in <hi>Terence?</hi> VVell, I have received my Portion, but alass! I ha' sold my Superiority of a Husband for Money. Is it not therefore better for a Man to Marry, a Handsome Girl, and a good Huswife, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> little or nothing, than to squander and forfeit the Birthright of his Creation for a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43678:92"/> Thousand Pound? Besides, there are some Men will say more in a VVeek, than they'll do in a Year: They'll promise Mountains, and give Mole Hills. Now if a Father can so order his business, as to put off his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for little or nothing; that is to say, if a Man can put of his Piss-kitchens with fair VVords and Promises, I think that Man has all the Pleasures of Matrimony in a Hopp-Sack. He has had the pleasure of getting his Daughters, the pleasure of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sips Feasts and Christ'nings, the pleasure of their Obedience and Attendance, the pleasure of seeing 'em grow up in Grace, Vertue, and Modesty; and lastly, the Pleasure of bestowing 'em to his mind, and cheating a young Gentleman, at the easie rate of fair VVords and large Promises, tickling him up with the Name of Son, and Sundays Dinners, and Laughing at him in your Sleve for the rest.</p>
               <p>I knew an old <hi>Hunks,</hi> that was one of the Masters of his Parish; and had been one of his Company too; one that had got an Estate as Tradesmen usually do, by down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Cheating. This Man had a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that was indifferent Snout Fair, and it was not for him that had been an Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Man all his Life long, to keep an idle Baggage in his House after Sixteen. Now
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43678:92"/> what does he do, he has her finely prank'd up, sends her to the Dancing-School, and pins a Report of no less than a Thousand Pound at her back, where ever she went. The Snare thus laid, the Birds come pecking about the Pit-fall, but some were wiser than some, till at length a smitten youngster comes to the point — your price Sir, (quo he) to the Father—Why Sir, (quo the Father,) you and I shall not fall out—I'll assure ye, Sir, I have given her as good breeding as most men of my Condition. But because there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more required in this Age, than Breeding; look ye, Sir, I have two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and I intend to give 'em both a like —I have but one Son, and I shall leave him sufficient besides.—But first, Sir, pray come and see my Daughter—for I sha'n't dispose of her against her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent—'tis not a Portion that I stick upon, but a good Husband, and such a one I know she deserves. Away goes the young Gentleman, and sees a young Girl, fine Cloths, a fine Face, and fine Al-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode Curchees—and thus the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary young Gull is drill'd on, and got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Noose, before he knows where he is.—Well, at length the business is concluded, with a promise of a thousand
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:43678:93"/> pound, and so away they go to Church. But in what a sad condition is the young man, when the Father-in-Law comes with his abatements—Either his Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vener is broke and run away with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into the <hi>Fleet</hi>—or else it lies in a Parliament man's hands, and he knows not how to sue him; however in kindness to his Daughter he'll strain hard for three hundred pounds, and so the young Man is forc'd to take home his bad Market; only he has the good hap to have a Father-in-Law that has good acquaintance; and if the worst comes to the worst, he'll procure him a Factors place in the <hi>East-Indies;</hi> in consideration of which he causes him to settle what he has upon his Wife, and so sends him packing. Let him die there if he pleases, his Daughter's ready for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with advantage, and now let her shift for her self—Now where's the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of Matrimony, for a man to be rid of his Trouble-Houses, at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of a few fine Cloths, and a slight Boarding-School-Breeding? And indeed if you consider the Conveniences of good Education, there is nothing more to be valued than that; let her be foul or fair, if she be well Educated, that's enough. A thousand pound! What's a thousand
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43678:93"/> pound? 'Tis spent in a Break-fast, or Gam'd away in one Night; but no man can Game away his Wives Education. Her skill in seasoning a Venison Pasty, is really to be valu'd at two hundred pound at least; her art in Raising a Turkey or a Goose-pye, is clearly to be reckon'd at the rate of three hundred pound; her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Marketing, is worth two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound more; and her skill in preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and making Plumm Cakes, and Dr. <hi>Stevens</hi>'s water, is worth at least five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds more. And there's as good as twelve hundred pounds of the Kings best Coin in <hi>England.</hi> Portions make Men bad Husbands, and Women proud Wives, and ruin more than they raise: He that chooses a Wife for the Portions sake, buys a Concubine, does not Marry a Wife. If it be a grievance of Matrimony, that a Man is not able to bestow a Portion upon his Daughter, 'tis a greater Discomfort to him, to see his Daughter return'd upon his Hands like a <hi>Bromingham</hi>-Groat, after the Consumption of his utmost Exhibition; which if he had never had to part withal, he had never been liable to that Discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Neither is it safe always to divulge what a Man intends to give with his Daughter, for if that be once spread abroad,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43678:94"/>
'tis ten thousand pounds to a Nut-shell, but there comes one smooth-chinn'd <hi>Slip-string</hi> or other, and makes a <hi>Pye-Corner</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of his Affection upon her Belly. She is betray'd by this Mid-wife, and t'other Nurse, or another old Beldam Conveigher of <hi>Billet-douxe's,</hi> and all her Fathers cark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and caring squander'd away upon a scape-goat of an Attorney's Clerk; or Coach'd away in a Moon-shine Night, from a Boarding-School, by a young Squire of seven hundred a year in <hi>No-land.</hi> We have heard of some too that have been Courted upon the report of being Heiresses, to that Condescention as to suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be let down from their Guardians Garret Window in a Dust Basket, as if they were making their Escapes for Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; then away to a Bed and a clean pair of Sheets, and so home again by Five a Clock i'the Morning, before any body's up, but the dear Conspiratress that fits up to let her in.</p>
               <p>But if a Man have but hopeful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, there's no fear of these Miscarriages. There are a sort of Hopeful Children as they call 'em, such as they who have them, enjoy the greatest blessing of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony imaginable, for many times they can shift for themselves without Portions.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:43678:94"/> Such as can swimm in the World without the Bladders of Dowries and Annuities. These are Sons and Daughters, that being sensible of the Inability of their Parents, can find a way to the Wood of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. I have heard of a Gentleman i'the Country, that had no less than Eight hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Daughters in a cluster; and what did he do with 'em? Why finding 'em all to be hopeful, he sent 'em all to <hi>London,</hi> and there was not one but shifted for her self. Now what was this Gentleman the worse for his Eight Daughters, or Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that produc'd 'em. Don't you know there is an Office of Intelligence in the Town? Certainly this Office was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd by such as had no Portions to give with their Daughters. For Ladies must have waiting Women, and those waiting women will have the Chaplains in spite of their Teeth: And therefore do but set up your Daughter with a good Suit of Cloths at first, and if she be but hopeful, I'll warrant ye, you hear no more of her. Which must of necessity be a great Comfort to their Parents. For the Recreation and Pleasure for a Man to see the Ingenuity of his <hi>hopeful</hi> Children, in shifting for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves is assuredly as great, as to stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Foyle, and see a Hare dance and double before the Hounds.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:43678:95"/>
               <p>Such <hi>hopeful</hi> Daughters as these we speak of, were the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Virgins of old, that waited at the Sea-side for Strangers, and permitted them the use of their Bodies, till they had got Money enough to Marry 'em honestly. For if Daughters will have Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where they cannot be had, they must fetch 'em out of the Fire. An old Fox thinks he has given his young Cubbs Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough, when he has taught 'em to shift in the World: At first he provides Lambs and Chicken for 'em; but when once they come to be at Age of discretion, he thinks it enough that he has begot 'em VVit and Parts, and leaves 'em to progg for themselves. How many wealthy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens have we had, that came to Town without Portions, in their Blue Breeches and Leather Doublets, arriv'd at great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, and then hang up their Leather Doublets and Blue Breeches, as Trophies of their Industry? Portions are the bane of Children; they make the young Men lazy, the young VVomen haughty, and both improvident; so that when they come to have a deep Bagg, that was none of their own getting; Heaven knows, they think it has no bottom: and what becomes of 'em then? VVhy, the VVomen turn up an Ace Trump, and so play out their
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43678:95"/> Game; and the Men provide themselves of Stone Doublets, that last as long as they live. 'Tis want of Portions that advances Ingenuity, teaches Parrots to speak, and Spaniels to set Partridges. A Mark a year well employ'd, is enough for a VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and for the Men, the VVorld is wide enough.</p>

                  </gap>n that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lay with a Man but her own Husband might set up for one of the most wealthy Empresses in the world. Thus we read in a Story of a certain King of <hi>Egypt</hi> whose name was <hi>Phero;</hi> who was strucken blind, and so continued for several years. At length he sent to consult the Oracle of some Heathen Deity or other, what he should do in the miserable condition he was in; by which he was answered, that if he wash'd
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43678:96"/> his Eyes with a Womans water, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had known any man but her own Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, he should recover his sight. You may be sure such a Prince as he, would spare for no cost, nor to make any search that might tend to his Relief. However as 'twas but reason, he try'd his own Wife first: But alas her water would do no feats. How many several varieties of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he afterwards try'd, the Lord of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> knows; but certain it is, the number was infinite. At length, when he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in despair, he met with one Woman's water that did his job. So soon as he was recover'd and well; he caus'd all the Women whose water he had experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in vain, to be herded together, and enclosed in one great City (by which you may guess there were a swinging cluster of 'em) and there caus'd 'em to be burnt all together City and all; and then took the Woman that had Cur'd him, as a Jewel only fit for a Prince, to his own Bed.</p>
               <p>What then is universal can never be a sure cause of discontent, since 'tis one man's Fortune as well as anothers. Besides, if the Natural Philosophers speak true, and they should understand the secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Women are much more prone to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous desires than Men. Nature it self
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43678:96"/> has so order'd it. How then can we think weak Women should be able to resist the violences and Impulses of Nature. Love will enter Nunneries, much more the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations of those Women that have tasted the Sweets of Amorous delights. Had she been chast, <hi>Lucretia</hi> had never stabb'd her self; 'twas a sign she had committed the Act, tho' afterwards she took a pet at her self for having done it; for to talk of Ravishing is a folly. On the otherside let Women be never so Chast, men will be shewing bad Examples; they will be bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their Chamber-maids; they will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baushing their Neighbours she Bed-fellows, and what better precedents can Women follow, than those of their Husbands. Nay some men are so simple to let other Men lie with their own Wives, and yet their own Wives shall know nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>There was a certain Gentleman, who had been for some years Marry'd to a very Vertuous VVife; but notwithstanding all her Vertue, he had more mind to his Maid; and to that purpose he resolv'd to make his Addresses to her. Now this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had a Friend in the same Parish, one of his own Complexion, but younger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom there was such an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Intimacy that they shar'd in all things
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43678:97"/> equally but their VVives. To him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gentleman declares the design he had upon his Maid; who not only encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd him, but promis'd him the utmost of his assistance, in hopes to have a share of the Booty. However the Maid was so coy, that being press'd with her Masters Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, she went and told her Mistress. The VVife glad of the opportunity, bid the Maid be patient a little longer, order'd her to comply with her Master by degrees and at length to appoint him her Bed-chamber such a Night. This the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-maid did, at which her Master was so overjoy'd, that he ran to tell his Friend what a Feast he was to have such a Night: who only desir'd him that he might have his leavings. The hour being come, the Master fail'd not to be with his Maid as he thought, but his VVife had supply'd his Room, and receiv'd him not as a Marry'd VVoman, but with the strivings and strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glings of an ignorant Virgin, and so car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd her self, that her Husband never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd her. At length having done as much as he could, gets up, and hasts to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to tell him how valiantly he had behav'd himself. Upon which his Friend minded him of his promise. Go then quickly, cry'd the Master, for fear she rise
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43678:97"/> of her self, or my Wife call her. Away runs the Friend a Gallop, and into Bed he flings himself and to work goes he with his Friends Wife, who thinking her Husband had been return'd with a new supply, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the Friend to do what he pleas'd; however she wonder'd at her Husbands Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, not having been accustomed to such Night-work. At length after the Friend had stay'd as long as he durst, the Friend flips of the Womans Thumb Ring in a Frolick; which she was the more willing to let go, believing it would rise up in Judgment against her Husband. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the two Intimado's met again to make repetition of their past joys; but then it was that the Maids Master discovering his Wives Ring upon his Friends Finger, cry'd out like a Man distracted, in the name of all the Devils in Hell, what have I done? I have e'en made a Cuckold of my self; however 'twas my Friend (quo he) and there's a Proverb or two to help me out at a dead lift, <hi>Harm watch, harm catch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Woman was acquitted as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; but the Husband was pointed at for a Cuckold to his dying day. Here's a Woman made her Husband a Cuckold, yet no man could say black was her Eye. So that 'tis not a Woman's making her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43678:98"/> a Cuckold is the Matter so much, but the letting it take Air when 'tis done. Had the Friend medled only with the Ring which the Husband lent him, and never taken the Ring of Gold, the Cuckolding had past without Discovery, and there had been no harm done.</p>
               <p>'Tis the pointing prating, World that makes the Cuckold, the Woman does but lie with another Man. The Son complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Father-in-Law of a Discovery he had made of his Wife. Well—and what could the Father say? Why he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired the Mother to take her Daughter to task in private, and give her a Juniper Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. She does so, and the Father and Son stood behind the Hangings and heard all. Fie Daughter—quo the Mother; I had thought you had had more Discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at these years—doe such a thing and be discovered! Fie upon't—where was your VVit? where were your Brains? I have been Married to your Father this thirty years and upwards, and have had many a private Friend in a Corner, and yet your Father can't say black's my Eye. Thus you see 'twas not the VVoman's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her Husband a Cuckold, but her being discovered, that had like to have spoiled all.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:43678:98"/>
               <p>I do not read of any Reason this VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had to make her Husband a Cuckold, but only she had it by Inheritance. But as for the greatest part of Women there is not one of a Thousand that will not give a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for making their Husbands Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olds.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they will alledge the Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and Suspicion of their Husbands; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Exasperates a Woman more than Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust; as if she had not Discretion enough to govern herself, without setting Guards and Spies and Governantees over her, to watch and observe her Behaviour. This occasioned the young Gentleman, who was no Town Fop, but a Person that knew all the Tricks of the World, and had been a great Practicioner himself in Love Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, to keep such a strict guard over his Wife.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman putting on his Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Cap, marry I must, quo he, for the support of my Name. But how shall we do to weather this cursed Cuckolds Point? —I that have made so many Cuckolds to be now cornuted at last! —hang't let the Family Perish—I won't marry— and yet I must marry, for I want a Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to redeem a part of my Estate—as good at first as at last — if there be no Remedy, 'tis not my Fate alone. After
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43678:99"/> these Consultations with himself, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions taken—away he goes, picks and chooses, and at length finds one as he thought to his mind, Rich, Handsome and Witty: After they were marryed home he brings her, and recommends her to the Care of an Old Nurse he had, and gives her such a strict Charge of his young Wife that she could not stir to piss, but the old Beldam was at her Heels. This severity the young Lady stomached, finding her self not Mistress of her own House; which made her yield at length to the Courtship of a young Gentleman, a Friend of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, that usually frequented the House, and one as well read in Loves Tackticks as her Husband; but how to compass the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Enjoyment was now the main study. Many Contrivances the young Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver projected, but all failed, by reason the Governante watched them so narrowly. But at last one hit. He had a Friend, a Mercer, in the Street through which the Lady was to pass to Church; and it was so ordered, that one Fore-noon as she was going to her Devotion, a pail of VVater was thrown out of the Mercer's Balcony seemingly by chance, that fell so unluckily luckily that the poor young Lady was washed from head to foot. VVhat should she do? There
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:43678:99"/> was no way but one. Nurse, quo she, I am all over wet to the Skin; I'll e'en step into this Gentleman's House, while you step home and fetch me some other Cloths to shift me.</p>
               <p>Away goes Nurse, and the Lady is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up stairs, where she found a good Fire, and her Friend ready to Caress her. The young Lover knew he had no time to lose, and therefore without giving her time to undress, he threw her upon the Bed close by the Fire, and performs his duty. In the mean time, the Old Nurse, being got home, and making a noise in the Chamber, the young Ladies Husband comes up, and finding his Governante alone, How now Nurse, (quo he) what makes you here? Where's my Wife? Thereupon she told her Master what had befallen her Mistress, and how she was come for new Garments to shift her. Oh the kind Devil, (quo the Gentleman) has he nick'd me so i'faith? This is a Trick that I never wrote down in my Table Book: there was but this one Trick but I knew 'em all. I am finely brought to Bed; there needs but one cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed hour to make a Man a Cuckold, and thou hast hit upon't.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:43678:100"/>
               <p>Now this Woman had reason to do as she did. For what Woman, think ye, can endure to be Snubb'd, and Snibb'd, and Curb'd, Watch'd, and Warded, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranniz'd over by a Husband, as if she had forfeited her Liberty with the loss of her Virginity? You shall never make Women believe, that Wedlock was made to enslave 'em; give 'em their Freedom, and you may win their Souls: But if you Check 'em and Curb 'em, they presently send for Legions of Devils to their Assistance, and you raise all Hell about your Ears.</p>
               <p>The next reason that Women alledge for Cornuting their Husbands is Revenge. Revenge is sweeter than Muskadine and Eggs, and all Women love sweet things. Women are not so Illiterate, but that they understand the Laws of Distributive Justice, and can tell ye, that what is Sawse for the Gander, is Sawse for the Goose. If they find themselves neglected, and slighted by a Surly Morose Husband at home, they think it but reason to accept the Caresses of a Loving and Obsequious Gallant abroad. Nor do they believe it the Intention of Matrimony, that they should lie alone. Besides, Women are generally conceited of their Birth, their Education, Parts, and Beauty: And therefore, if they find their
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:43678:100"/> Husbands run a Catterwawling after Misses less Amiable, or less Witty than themselves, it presently turns their Love into Fury, and they presently seek a Revenge answerable to the Affront they have receiv'd. Besides, Women read Novels and Stories, and they furnish 'em with Examples and Presidents without number. One among the rest shall suffice of a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman that liv'd at Court in high Favour with his Prince; and indeed in that great esteem, that tho the Gentleman were poor, the King found out a Match for him, and Marry'd him to an Heiress very Young, Transcendently Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and so vastly Rich, that she had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to maintain both her self and him too, in a Port equal to the best of his Rank. At first, this Young Lady doated on her new Husband, and lov'd him with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Affection. But the Gentleman being Infatuated with the Allurements of an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Court-Lady, stuck so close to his stale Mistriss, that he abandon'd the Society of his Young and Lovely Wife, and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come near her. Nevertheless this would not withdraw the young Ladies affection from her Husband; but still she continu'd for several Years labouring with all the Complacency and Indulgence imaginable to gain her Husband's Love, but nothing would
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43678:101"/> prevail. What did the young Lady do then? Why, at length when she saw her Beauty and her Affection Scorn'd, Despis'd, and Slighted, and that there was no Remedy but she must lie alone as long as her Husband liv'd, she e'en Courted another young Gentleman her self, and besought him to have pity upon her Condition; who finding her so lovely and so youthful as she was, could not find in his heart to be stiff-neck'd as her Husband, but glad of the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, readily supply'd his place. When this came to her Husbands ear, he would fain have been Friends with her, but then she disdain'd him as much as he had scorn'd her before. No (quo she) <hi>Quit</hi> for <hi>Quo</hi> is the Law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi> You your self have been the Author of your own and my misfortune; you your self have given the Example; an Example that has far out gone me in this, that what you have done has been ungratefully acted both toward the King and my self, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Honour or Conscience: Those Laws that throw so much dishonour upon Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that live with other Men besides their Husbands, do not exempt those Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands that live with other Mens Wives; and so saying, she flung away from him without vouchsafing to hear his Reply.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:43678:101"/>
               <p>Can any Man deny but that this Lady had both Reason and Justice on her side? And therefore if men will sacrifice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Cuckoldship, who can help it? For Women are sooner overcome by Anger and Revenge, than by Love and Courtship.</p>
               <p>But there are another sort of Women, as well piously as voluptuously given, that love to make their Husbands Cuckolds on purpose that they may send 'em to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Now this is a charitable considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion surmounting all the rest; for they find their Husbands very Wicked, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern-hunters, Gamesters; nay and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times coming home by Cod-peice weeping-cross, the Effects of Suburb-sinning. They use all means to reclaim 'em, give 'em all the good Exhortations imaginable— Fie Husband this will never do—you impair you Estate, you weaken your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy—but more than all this, what think you will become of your Soul?— But the poor Women preach to deaf Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges—there is no heed given to their word—and therefore; Compassionate Wives as they are, they cornute the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Husbands in this World, to make 'em happy in the other. Tho' to say truth this may be rather said to be gratitude than cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Women to send their Husbands
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43678:102"/> to Heaven by <hi>Cornutement,</hi> considering how kind the Men are, in deflowring Virgins, to prevent their leading Apes in Hell. But let it be Charity, or Gratitude, or what it will, the pretence can never be bad that sends Men to Heaven. And therefore this was the Reason, that the Country-man coming home and finding the Curate of the Parish a Bed with his Wife, never said a word either to the one or the other; for thought he, a Curate's Cuckold can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want absolution of his Sins.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it happens that the Man provokes his Friend to make him a Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kold, whether he will or no. As it fell out between two Friends that had made a perpetual vow of Friendship one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, One of these Friends chances to Marry a handsome Wife: And had he not been a Jealous Cuckow-brains, he and his Wife and his Friend might have liv'd hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, for ought I know till Death. But Such was his misfortune, that in a short time after he was Wedlock'd, he grew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a violent mistrust of his Friend. Of which his Friend being informed by the Lady, Companion of mine (said he) to the Husband, I hear you entertain fears and jealousies of my Familiarity with your Wife; Certainly you have but an ill O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:43678:102"/> of my Friendship, to think that I would dissolve that Unity, which has so long continued between us, for the Love of a Woman. Not he by his Soul, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any such Thought; and therefore they were wicked Lyers that told him so. His Friend was satisfy'd for that Time, but not long after he heard the same Nightingale sing him the same Note, which put him into such a Fury, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had reproach'd his Friend for his breach of that vow'd Friendship that was between 'em, he left his House indeed, but never left laying close Siege to his Wife, till he had cornuted his Companion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his desert.</p>
               <p>By this Men may learn to grow wary how they unjustly suspect their Wives; for there cannot be a greater displeasure to a Man or Woman, than to be suspected without a Cause; and therefore if a Man will be Cornuted, let him be Cornuted. Questionless such Men have read the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Gods, and finding that <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> wore Horns, when he Courted <hi>Europa,</hi> and that <hi>Pan</hi> wore Horns when he Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Nymph <hi>Syrinx,</hi> believe it no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to wear Horns, and then there's no harm done, nor can Matrimony undergo any Scandal thereby.</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:43678:103"/>
               <p>But then again, suppose it be the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion; There's no man cares to be out of the Fashion: and therefore he has no reason to be Discontented at it. If it be the Fashion to wear Horns, why should they not be worn as well as Hats? Why should a man grieve and torment his mind for being in the Fashion? Rather let him consider that it has been a Custom and a Law so made by prescription of near four thousand years, and comfort himself that he has the same Law, the same Custom, and the same Reason which the Women have.</p>

And then 'tis no more than he deserves; for she that has a generous Husband that loves to see a well spread Table, never need to be put to these petty shifts. 'Tis a sign she's honest, and believe me, that's a great pleasure of Matrimony; for had she a mind to take up a Stone with her Ear, she might have a now of those Dainties at the Tavern every day, without asking her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or putting her self to the trouble of mocking Mortality.</p>
               <p>'Tis sometimes a piece of pomp for a VVoman to mure her self up in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and pretend to take Physick, and have her Men Midwifes about her to talk Smut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for an hour or two. Sometimes there may be a design in it, and the Husband see's the Gentleman she shuts her self up for go up in the shape of a Doctor; but if he ask what his VVife Ails, he shall never

For upon such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions as these Women have the same Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as Politicians, to Counterfeit Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses when they find it necessary: And to eat strong Meats, as Beef, and Mutton, when they say they are Sick, would spoil the Plot: No, Partridge and young Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken are more suitable. I think it ought to be a great pleasure to a Man, that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent his Wife at so cheap a rate. But where's the Money all this while? Money? Why there are a thousand Shifts and Tricks to get Money; and he's a pitiful, Brainless Fellow, that has not two or three of those Thousand. I knew a Man that was a necessary Implement to some Persons that liv'd by their Wits; these people drank at the Tavern, kept their Consultations at the Tavern, and went out and came in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, two or three times in a day.

               <p>To conclude, Sickness brings a Woman sometimes to Confession; nay, to such a Confession, as brings the Husband both Joy, Consolation, and Pleasure, all at a time. For there was an Indulgent Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and questionless, he was not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Husband in the World that ever had the same good fortune befal him; for what has once been done, may have been done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and may be done again: I say there was a certain Indulgent Husband, who had a Wife, who partly by the Vales which her Husband allow'd her out of his Trade, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the good Management of her Market Expences, and other private Savings, had muster'd together the Laudable Sum of Three Hundred Pound, which she secur'd against a Rainy day, where she resolv'd her Husband should never have the fingering of it. The Husband did not wave his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction because his Wife was sick; but carry'd her to <hi>Epsom,</hi> and did all he could to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her: But still for a time she grew worse and worse, and thought she should die. Now whether it were that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Kindness won her Heart, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were any Needle of Death that prickt her Conscienee, we will not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but so it was, that in the Agony of one of her <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43678:107"/> Husband, and told him that she had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lay heavy upon her Conscience: No wonder marry, for Three Hundred Pound in Silver, is no such easie burthen for a Sick and Weak Conscience, tho it had been the Conscience of a Wine-Porter in her Condition. She told her Husband, I say, that she had a mind to lie quiet in her Grave, and not to be forc'd to walk after she was Dead, as she had heard many had been constrain'd to jaunt it from one World to the other i' their Winding-Sheets, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover hidden Treasure; and therefore, she resolv'd to prevent that Inconvenience: With that she made him privy to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment of no less than Three Hundred Pound, which had he Dy'd before her, she intended to have made use of her self: but since Heaven had otherwise dispos'd of her, she desir'd him to make good use of it, only to spare her a small Monument out of it, which as it would continue her Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, would be an Ornament also to the Church.</p>
               <p>The Husband was not a little overjoy'd at these Blessed Tydings; away he goes, finds out the Nest, and with the same ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerness as a Vulture stoops to his Prey, laid violent hands upon the Money, returning a Thousand Thanks to his Wife's Sickness,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:43678:107"/> that had nipp'd out of her Conscience so rich a Discovery.

However, the Husband had the pleasure of handling the Money, and he cry'd, Well fare a Sick Wife. And I dare be bold to say, had other Men the same good fortune, they would never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of Sick Wives.

               <p>Let all the Women in the World say what they please, there's none of 'em shall perswade any Man of Reason, that it can be a pleasure to any Woman to lie by a Man that will never let her take her rest, for Coughing, Spitting, Spawling, Groaning, Grunting, and withal perfuming her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils with the poysonous steams of a Charnel-house Breath.</p>
               <p>Most gentelely therefore did the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman do, who when she saw her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band lay a dying, beyond all Recovery of <hi>Drops</hi> and Spirits of <hi>Bezoar,</hi> and that the Doctors had given him over, and that as
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:43678:110"/> the old Nurses Phrase it, he began to change, taking a Glass of Wine off the Side-board; <hi>Here, Sweet-heart,</hi> (quo she) <hi>here's to ye, I wish ye a good passage.</hi> Certainly it shew'd this Gentlewoman had no Malice in her Heart, when she desir'd to part so fairly.</p>
               <p>And who knows what reason the <hi>Baker</hi>'s Wife might have for what she did, who when her Husband was dead; sent for the Sexton, and ask'd him how deep he usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally digg'd his Graves? So deep (reply'd the Sexton) then (quo she) make my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Grave so many Foot deeper: and then shewing him a hugeous Timber Logg that she had in the House; be sure (quo sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But when the Husband is dead, what then? Why then the Widow must be allow'd to keep her Chamber, darken her Room, and keep out the very Sun, as having got an ill Name for being a <hi>Tell-Tale;</hi> she must admit none but her most trusty Friends, who
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:43678:110"/> come to chear up her heart with Sack and Sugar, and tickle her Fancy with Proposals of a new Choice; but if any Stranger come in, then she must sit with a Compos'd Countenance, and as mute as if her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band had taken her Tongue along with him. Then she must put her self into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Mourning, wear a Peak, vow and protest she'll never marry agen, and then give out—give out? you'll say, what's that? so much in Jewels, so much in Plate, so much in ready Cash, and so much in good Debts—that's call'd <hi>giving out.</hi> If she be a person of Quality, then the Body must lie in State, and four or five <hi>Momphazzards,</hi> or <hi>Jack-hold-my-Staff</hi>'s must stand in their Long Sable Cloaks to watch, least the Devil fetch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way poor <hi>Mortuus est</hi> before they can Bury him. Then let there be a pompous Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral with Scutcheons, and then she shall bear the Appellation of the RICH WI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOW.</p>
               <p>These may be called the pleasures of los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Husband. And what then? Why, by this time the Remembrance of her first Husband begins to wear out of her Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and she begins to set up for <hi>Widow Catchdolt.</hi> And thus the Game begins She takes fair Lodgings, and a cunning:
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:43678:111"/> Wench to her Servant. The Mistriss talks at the rate of a Thousand a year, the Maid at Two thousand. The Mistriss shews her self every day at Morning Prayers: She pretends to Fast that day of the VVeek that her Husband died; that's to shew her her good Nature, and respect to her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd Husband. The Maid <hi>Madam's</hi> her at every word; and in all her discourse with the Servants of the House, talks of nothing but what great matches her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss might have had; and what a good Condition'd saving thrifty VVoman she is—There is but one thing vexes her, that her Mistriss sends her about to her At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornies and Sollicitors, upon so many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands that she has hardly time to mend her Stockins.</p>
               <p>Now the noise of a Rich VVidow, flies about the Town, as swift as Fire-works upon a Rope; she is quickly smelt out by young Fops, old Usurers, middle ag'd Bankrupts; but she keeps 'em all at the staves end. At length she culls out one fit for her purpose; and to him at first she shews some glimmerings of her Favour— tells him she had never any thoughts of Marriage—for indeed, what should she that had enough to live on of her own, free and uncontroul'd, thrust her self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

               <p>Now what of all this? If the Man be but so Ingenious as to learn the true Knack of <hi>all Fours,</hi> he may get his Drink, and a Penny-Roll too into the Bargain, and sit merry i' the Ale-House till the Bell-man cry <hi>Past Two a Clock, and a Star-Light Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> But you'll say he must go home i' the Morning; at least, if he can't go he must reel home with emptiness in his Pocket: However his Heart is light, and that's the main Business of all.

For the Vulgar of <hi>England</hi> are plaguy Learned; and know their Privilege by Creation, and the Law of Nature, as well as the Parson of the Parish.</p>
               <p>And now the poor Man is become irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably lost, he minds neither his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling nor his Home.

At her she lets fly whole Volleys of Jades, Bitches, Whores, and would have been at her Coif too, but that the Men prevented her. But seeing she cannot have her Revenge that way, she sends a showre of Candlesticks, Black-Pots, and Tabaco-Pipes at her Husbands Head, who takes all patiently for the present, because the Peace is carefully kept by the Standers by. Now what of all this? This is all Natural, and where things run in a Natural Course, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let a Man trouble himself to disturb the Order of Nature. Men of Breeding Love to live at quiet with their Wives: But the Rabble love this Hoggish, brawling, brang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Life of Necessity.

Which threats of the young Lad, who was look'd upon by the Couper as a Scholar, and one that studied the black Art, made such a deep Impression in the Couper's Mind, that 'twas above a Month after his Wedding before he could Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish his Marriage.

But if Men or Women will be too busie with these Potions, 'tis not the fault of Matrimony, but the folly of them that make too Excessive use of them, which brings them to untimely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Tho sometimes they may serve a Man in great stead, when having quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled with his Wife without a Cause, he desires Reconciliation. Then let him take a moderate Dose, and he will find a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pleasure, not only Pleasures of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but of the renewed Amity with his Wife.</p>
               <p>And thus we have run through all the Pleasures of, in and about Matrimony, wherein, as we find nothing that deserves so many loud Out-cries against it; so we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but look upon these Murmurers against it, to be only such as care not for the Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Ceremony; a loose sort of People, that reject all Laws of convenience, when repugnant to their own Appetites. And therefore since we cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Matrimony, nor propagate the World without it, we must look upon those who thus exclaim against it, and cry it down, as the Enemies of Man-kind.</p>
